        <h2>Teleological argument for gods existence</h2>
         <p> Introduction to the teleological argument for god's existence. </p>
         <P>Some phenomena within nature exhibit such exquisiteness of structure function or interconnectedness that many people have found it natural to see a deliberative and directive mind behind those phenomena. Many Great minds wrote about the teleological argument including : Plato, Cicero, Thomas Aquianas, Immanuel Kant And etc. My personal favorite is Immanuel kants argument on this but i will be discussing the teleological argument in general ( Including those philosophers arguments). Philosophically inclined thinkers have both historically and at present labored to shape the relevant intuition into a more formal, logically rigorous inference. The result of this  was  theistic arguments in differnet logical  forms,  intention and design allthought they share (mostly ) the same arguments about god.      </P>
         <p>It is not uncommon for humans to find themselves with the intuition that random, unplanned, unexplained accident just couldn’t produce the order, beauty, elegance, and seeming purpose that we experience in the natural world around us. As Hume’s interlocutor Cleanthes puts it we seem to see “the image of mind reflected on us from innumerable objects” in nature. many people find themselves convinced that no explanation for that mind-resonance which fails to acknowledge a causal role for intelligence, intent and purpose in nature can be seriously plausible. In another words the argument simply posits that such things as : morality, beauty, intelligence, intent etc was created by a designer ( God) and that such things wouldn't be logical to happen in a natural process.  The historical arguments of interest are precisely the potentially problematic ones—inferences beginning with some empirical features of nature and concluding with the existence of a designer. A standard but separable second step—the natural theology step—involves identifying the designer as God, often via particular properties and powers required by the designing in question.  The question remains about the formal structure of such arguments. What sort of logic is being employed? As it turns out, the  question does not have just a single answer. Several distinct answers are included in the teleological argument.
        </p>
         <p> Analogical Design Arguments: Schema 1
        </p>
         <p>Design arguments are roughly classed as analogical arguments. Lets follow through some premises:
        </p>
         <p>1)Entity e within nature (or the cosmos, or nature itself) is like specified human artifact a (a machine) in relevant respects R.
            2)a has R precisely because it is a product of deliberate design by intelligent human agency.
            3)Like effects typically have like causes (or like explanations, like existence requirements etc.)
            Therefore
            
            </p>
         <p>4)It is (highly) probable that e has R precisely because it too is a product of deliberate design by intelligent, relevantly human-like agency(God).
        </p>
         <p>Despite Hume’s earlier demurs that things in nature are not really very like artifacts such as machines, most people who are most familiar with nature’s dazzling intricacies freely admit that nature abounds with things that look designed—that are intention-shaped. For instance, Francis Crick (no fan of design) issued a warning to his fellow biologists:
        </p>
         <p>Biologists must constantly keep in mind that what they see was not designed, but rather evolved.  But it can be argued that the evolution was part of gods plan so the argument keeps plain. From this we can make a analogical argument number 2, Schema 2:

         </p>
         <P>5)Some things in nature (or nature itself, the cosmos) are design-like (exhibit a cognition-resonating, intention-shaped character R)
            6)Design-like properties (R) are not producible by (unguided) natural means any phenomenon exhibiting such Rs must be a product of intentional design.
            Therefore:
            </P>
         <P>7) Some things in nature (or nature itself, the cosmos) are products of intentional design, which in turn requires agency of some type...

         </P>
         <P>William Paley famously sees no design-like properties in a stone, but finding a watch on the ground would be another matter. Unlike the stone, it could not always have been there. Why not you would ask.  For this reason, and for no other, namely, that when we come to inspect the watch, we perceive—what we could not discover in the stone—that its several parts are framed and put together for a purpose … [The requisite] mechanism being observed … the inference we think is inevitable, that the watch must have had a maker. ... Every observation which was made in our first chapter concerning the watch may be repeated with strict propriety concerning the eye, concerning animals, concerning plants, concerning, indeed, all the organized parts of the works of nature. … [T]he eye … would be alone sufficient to support the conclusion which we draw from it, as to the necessity of an intelligent Creator.  Paley’s argument is routinely construed as analogical, it contains an informal statement of the above variant argument type. Paley goes on for two chapters discussing the watch, discussing the properties in it which evince design, and destroying potential objections to concluding design in the watch. It is only then that entities in nature come onto the horizon.
        </P>
         <P>many were convinced that the appropriate Rs in question were in their own right directly reflective of and redolent of cognition, that this directly suggested mind, that we could see nearly directly that they were the general sort of thing that a mind might or even would generate, and that consequently they did not depend for their evidential force upon previously established known instances of design. When we see a text version of the Gettysburg Address, that text says mind to us in a way totally unrelated to any induction or analogy from past encounters with written texts. It was that type of testimony to mind, to design, that some historical advocates of design arguments believed that they found in some Rs observed in nature—a testimony having no dependency on induction or analogy. Beauty, purpose and in general value especially when conjoined with delicate complexity were popular underlying intuitive marks. Intricate, dynamic, stable, functioning order of the sort we encounter in nature was frequently placed in this category. Such order was taken to be suggestive of minds in that it seemed nearly self-evidently the sort of thing minds were prone to produce. It was a property whose mind-resonating character we could unhesitatingly attribute to intent. With this lets go to schema 3.
        </P>
         <P>Inferences to the Best Explanation/Abductive Design Arguments: Schema 3:
        </P>
         <P>The basic idea is that if one among a number of competing candidate explanations is overall superior to others in significant respects—enhanced likelihood, explanatory power and scope, causal adequacy, plausibility, evidential support, fit with already-accepted theories, predictiveness, fruitfulness, precision, unifying power, and the like—then we are warranted in (provisionally) accepting that candidate as the right explanation given the evidence in question (Lipton 1991, 58). Some advocates see design arguments as inferences to the best explanation, taking design explanations—whatever their weaknesses—as prima facie superior to chance, necessity, chance-driven evolution, or something like that whatever.
        </P>
         <P>A general schema deployed in the current case would give us the following: Schema 3:
        </P>
         <P>8)Some things in nature (or nature itself, the cosmos) exhibit exquisite complexity, delicate adjustment of means to ends (and other relevant R characteristics).
            9)The hypothesis that those characteristics are products of deliberate, intentional design (Design Hypothesis) would adequately explain them.
            10)In fact, the hypothesis that those characteristics are products of deliberate, intentional design (Design Hypothesis) is the best available overall explanation of them.
            Therefore 
            
            </P>
         <P>11)Some things in nature (or nature itself, the cosmos) are products of deliberate, intentional design (meaning the Design Hypothesis is likely true).
            In arguments of this type, superior explanatory virtues of a theory are taken as constituting epistemic support for the acceptability of the theory or for the likely truth of the theory.
            
            </P>
         <P>There are, of course, multitudes of purported explanatory, epistemic virtues, including the incomplete list a couple of paragraphs back. Assessing hypotheses in terms of such virtues is often contentious. The assessment of ‘best’ is not only a value-tinged judgment, but is notoriously tricky (especially given the ambiguous and hard to pinpoint import of the Rs in the present case). There is also the very deep question of why we should think that features which we humans find attractive in proposed explanations should be thought to be truth-tracking. What sort of justification might be available here?</P>
         <P>IBE, Likelihood and Bayes One key underlying structure in this context is typically traced to Peirce’s notion of abduction. Suppose that some otherwise surprising fact e would be a reasonably expectable occurrence were hypothesis h true. That, Peirce argued, would constitute at least some provisional reason for thinking that h might be true. Peirce’s own characterization was as follows:

         </P>
         <P>Schema 3:

         </P>
         <P>The surprising fact, C, is observed.
            But if A were true, C would be a matter of course.
            Hence,
            </P>
         <P>There is reason to suspect that A is true. The measure of C being a ‘matter of course’ given A is frequently described as the degree to which C could be expected were A true. This intuition is sometimes—though explicitly not by Peirce himself—formalized in terms of likelihood, defined as follows:
        </P>
         <P>The likelihood of hypothesis H (given evidence  E) = P(E|H) The likelihood of h is the probability of finding evidence e given that the hypothesis h is true. In cases of competing explanatory hypotheses H1 and H2 the comparative likelihoods on specified evidence can be taken to indicate which of the competitors the evidence better supports: Likelihood Principle:

         </P>
         <P>|P(E|H1) > P(E|H2)| ( in this case e supports  H1 more than it does H2)
            Therefore God is more likely to exist than for him to not.
            
            </P>

		<h2>Fine-tuning argument.</h2>
		<p>  Cosmological: Fine-tuning
        </p>
        <P>Intuitively, if the laws of physics were different, the evolution of life would not have taken the same path. If gravity were stronger, for example, then flying insects and giraffes would most likely not exist. Contemporary physics provides significantly more drama to the story. Even an extraordinarily small change in one of many key parameters in the laws of physics would have made life impossible anywhere in the universe. Consider two examples:
        </P>
        <P>The expansion rate of the universe is represented by the cosmological constant Λ. If Λ were slighter greater, there would be no energy sources, such as stars. If it were slightly less, the Big Bang would have quickly led to a Big Crunch in which the universe collapsed back onto itself. For life to be possible, Λ cannot vary more than one part in 1053 (Collins 2003)

        </P>
        <P>Life depends on, among other things, a balance of carbon and oxygen in the universe. If the strong nuclear force were different by 0.4%, there would not be enough of one or the other for life to exist (Oberhummer, Csótó, and Schlattl 2000). Varying this constant either way “would destroy almost all carbon or almost all oxygen in every star” (Barrow 2002, 155). Many examples of fine-tuning have to do with star formation. Stars are important since life requires a variety of elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. Stars contain the only known mechanism for producing large quantities of these elements and are therefore necessary for life. Lee Smolin estimates that when all of the fine-tuning examples are considered, the chance of stars existing in the universe is 1 in 10229. “In my opinion, a probability this tiny is not something we can let go unexplained. Luck will certainly not do here; we need some rational explanation of how something this unlikely turned out to be the case”  (Smolin 1999, 45) Smolin is not merely claiming that all improbable events require an explanation, but some improbable events are special. (In poker, every set of five cards dealt to the dealer has the same probability, assuming that the cards are shuffled sufficiently. If the dealer is dealt a pair on three successive hands, no special explanation is required. If the dealer is dealt a royal flush on three successive hands, an explanation would rightly be demanded, and the improbability of this case isn’t even close to the magnitude of the improbability that Smolin mentioned.) Physicists who have written on fine-tuning agree with Smolin that it cries out for an explanation. (What physicists in general think is, of course, harder to determine.) One explanation is that the universe appears to be fine-tuned for the existence of life because it literally has been constructed for life by an intelligent agent.
        </P>
        <P>There are two other types of responses to fine-tuning: (i) it does not, in fact, require a special explanation, and (ii) there are alternative explanations to theistic design. Let’s briefly consider these (also see the entry on fine-tuning). Sober gives a related but stronger argument based on observational selection effects (Sober 2009, 77–80). Say that Jones nets a large number of fish from a local lake, all of which are over 10 inches long. Let Hall  = ‘all of the fish in the lake are over 10 inches long’ and H1/2  = ‘Half of the fish in the lake are over 10 inches long’. The evidence  e is such that P(e|Hall) > P(e|H1/2) . Now say that Jones discovers that his net is covered with 10 inch holes, preventing him from capturing any smaller fish. In that case e does not favor one hypothesis over the other. The evidence  is an artifact of the net itself, not a random sample of the fish in the lake. When it comes to fine-tuning, Sober considers Hdesing = ‘the constants have been set in place by an intelligence, specifically God’, and Hchance  = ‘the constants are what they are as a matter of mindless random chance’. While intuitively 
            P(constants are just right for life|Hdesign)> P(constants are just right for life |Hchance) meaning its more likely that its more likely theres a designer
            
            </P>
        <P>But some people might say " oh but there can be other universes with different laws and conditions that can allow our life " but this is simply not true as a universe with different laws or conditions or a multiverse is simply impossible.</P>
        <P>Lets debunk the multiverse theory with the following images:</P>

		<h2>Anselm's Ontological Argument</h2>
		<p> Anselm's ontological argument purports to be an a priori proof of God's existence. Anselm starts with premises that do not depend on experience for their justification and then proceeds by purely logical means to the conclusion that God exists. His aim is to refute the fool who says in his heart that there is no God (Psalms 14:1). This fool has two important features.

        </p>
        <P>He understands the claim that God exists.

            </P>
        <P>He does not believe that God exists.
        </P>
        <P>Anselm's goal is to show that this combination is unstable. Anyone who understands what it means to say that God exists can be led to see that God does exist. On this view, the atheist is not just mistaken: his position is internally inconsistent.

        </P>
        <P>What follows is an attempt to clarify the argument as it is presented in Chapter II of the Proslogium. The argument in Chapter III is rather different, and in some ways more interesting. After you have worked through this page, you might try to produce a similar gloss on the second argument. This will not be easy: the argument is notoriously complicated. But you might find it a useful exercise nonetheless.
            Let's work through the argument as Anselm presents it.
            
            </P>
        <P>Anselm writes:
        </P>
        <P>... we believe that thou art a being than which nothing greater can be conceived.
            This is Anselm's definition. We might paraphrase it as follows:
            </P>
        <P>By "God" we mean an absolutely unsurpassable being, a being that cannot conceivably be improved upon.
            As we've stressed, you do not need to agree that this is what the word "God" ordinarily means. Treat it as a stipulation. Clearly, if Anselm can establish the existence of a being of this sort, his conclusion would be of immense philosophical and theological significance.
            
            </P>
        <P>Or is there no such nature, since the Fool has said in his heart, there is no God?
            This puts the question: Is there in fact a being with the properties our definition assigns to God?
            
            </P>
        <P>But, at any rate, this very fool, when he hears of this being of which I speak - a being than which nothing greater can be conceived - understands what he hears, and what he understands is in his understanding; although he does not understand it to exist.
            This begins and ends straightforwardly. The fool understands the definition of God but denies that God exists. The first hint of strangeness comes in what seems to be a parenthetical remark: "what he understands is in his understanding". Anselm apparently proposes to treat the understanding or the mind as if it were a place, and to speak of things existing "in the understanding". Anselm's assumption here is that if I understand claims about God, then we may say that God exists in my understanding or in my mind.
            </P>
        <P>For it is one thing for an object to be in the understanding, another to understand that the object exists. For when a painter first conceives of what he will afterwards perform, he has it in his understanding be he does not yet understand it to be, because he has not yet performed it. But after he has made the painting, he both has it in his understanding and he understands that it exists, because he has made it.
        </P>
        <P>Anselm here explains a distinction. It is one thing for an object to exist in my understanding, and another for me to understand it to exist. This is a familiar distinction, even if the terms are not familiar. Ghosts, trolls, flying saucers and the like are all things I can think about. We might say that I have ideas of these things; Anselm says that they exist in the understanding. Anselm's point is that in general there is a difference between saying that something exists in my understanding and saying that I understand (or believe) it to exist. Trolls exist in my understanding; but I do not understand them to exist.
        </P>
        <P>Hence even the fool is convinced that something exists in the understanding, at least, than which nothing greater can be conceived. For when he hears of this, he understands it. And whatever is understood, exists in the understanding.
            Here Anselm applies the distinction he has just drawn to the case of God. The fool understands claims about God. So God - a being than which none greater can be conceived - exists in his understanding. Anselm means this to be an entirely uncontroversial claim.
            
            </P>
        <P>And assuredly, that than which nothing greater can be conceived cannot exist in the understanding alone: then it can be conceived to exist in reality, which is greater.
        </P>
        <P>Therefore, if that than which nothing greater can be conceived exists in the understanding alone, the very being than which nothing greater can be conceived is one than which a greater can be conceived. But obviously this is impossible.
            This is the heart of the argument. The trick is to show that God cannot possibly exist in the understanding alone. Anselm begins by contrasting existing in the understanding with existing in reality. This by itself is not problematic. Trolls exist in the understanding alone; Bill Clinton exists both in the understanding and in reality; and no doubt there are things that exist in reality that do not yet exist in the understanding because no human being has ever managed to frame a thought about them. The picture seems to be as follows:
            
            </P>
        <div class="image-container">
            <div class="image-pair">
              <img src="c:\Users\nikol\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2024-05-01 122533.png" alt="">
              <p>  In the area marked A we have things that exist in the understanding alone; in the area marked B we have things that exist both in the understanding and in reality; and in the area marked C we have things that exist in reality but not in the understanding. (For obvious reasons, we cannot give any concrete examples of the last category.)
            </p>
              <P>At this stage the fool has conceded that God exists in the understanding: so God belongs either in A or in B. Anselm now argues that God cannot exist in the understanding alone. The argument seems to proceed as follows.
            </P>
              <P>(1) Suppose (with the fool) that God exists in the understanding alone.
            </P>
              <P>(2) Given our definition, this means that a being than which none greater can be conceived exists in the understanding alone.</P>
              <P>(3) But this being can be conceived to exist in reality. That is, we can conceive of a circumstance in which theism is true, even if we do not believe that it actually obtains.
            </P>
              <P>(4) But it is greater for a thing to exist in reality than for it to exist in the understanding alone.
            </P>
              <P>(5) Hence we seem forced to conclude that a being than which none greater can be conceived can be conceived to be greater than it is.
            </P>
              <P>(6) But that is absurd.

              </P>
              <P>(7) So (1) must be false. God must exist in reality as well as in the understanding.
            </P>
              <P>This reading of the argument is amply confirmed by the final paragraph:
            </P>
              <P>Therefore, if that than which nothing greater can be conceived exists in the understanding alone, the very being than which nothing greater can be conceived is one than which a greater can be conceived. But obviously this is impossible. Hence there is no doubt that there exists a being than which nothing greater can be conceived, and it exists both in the understanding and in reality.
            </P>
              <P>This is a useful first pass at the argument. Now let's go over it and try to isolate its most fundamental assumptions. (I'll highlight the premises of the reconstructed argument in red.) Remember the argument's dialectical context. The aim is to refute the fool - or less tendentiously, the rational atheist. So what we want to know about these premises is whether the fool should accept them. There is first the definition:
            </P>
              <P>(a) By "God" we mean "a being than which no greater being can be conceived"
            </P>
              <P>Then there are some assumptions about the Fool's understanding.
            </P>
              <P>(b) We understand what it means to speak of a being than which no greater can be conceived. We understand what these words mean.
            </P>
              <P>(c) We can conceive of such a being's existing in reality.
            </P>
              <P>Anselm now assumes a principle that he clearly regards as trivial.
            </P>
              <P>(d) If we understand what it means to speak of X, then X exists in the understanding.
            </P>
            <P>From (a),(b) and (d) we may now infer:

            </P>
            <P>(e) God exists in the understanding.
            </P>
            <P>(Note: this is not a premise. It is an intermediate conclusion supported by a quick argument from premises we have already accepted.)
            </P>
            <P>Anselm now employs a form of reasoning called reductio ad absurdum. This is a very useful technique. In a proof of this sort, we begin by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove. Then we derive a contradiction or an absurdity from this supposition. And from this we conclude that our original assumption was false. The general form of such an argument is as follows:
            </P>
            <P>Suppose P
            </P>
            <P>From P it follows that Q
            </P>
            <P>But Q is absurd (self-contradictory).
            </P>
            <P>Therefore P is false.
            </P>
            <P>For Anselm the target of his reduction is the proposition that God exists in the understanding alone. So let us suppose that this is the case:
            </P>
            <P>(f) Suppose that God exists in the understanding but not in reality.

            </P>
            <P>From (f) and (c) we may now infer
            </P>
            <P>
                (g) God in fact exists in the understanding alone, but he may be conceived to exist in reality as well as in the understanding.
                </P>
            <P>At this point Anselm wields what is perhaps his most controversial premise. It is hard to know exactly how to formulate it. But something like the following seems to be what Anselm has in mind.
            </P>
            <P>(h) If something exists in the understanding alone, but can be conceived to exist in reality, then that thing can be conceived to be greater than it actually is.
            </P>
            <P>The idea seems to be: if we compare two things that are alike in all respects except that one exists in the understanding alone and the other exists in reality, then the one that exists in reality is clearly greater, better, more perfect. We will have to discuss the cogency of this assumption in class. But suppose for now that it is granted. We may then argue as follows. From (g) and (h) it follows that
            </P>
            <P>(I) God can be conceived to be greater than it actually is.

            </P>
            <P>But this is absurd. For given our definition (a), this just means that
            </P>
            <P>(j) A being that cannot be conceived to be greater than it is can be conceived to be greater than it is.

            </P>
            <P>From which it follows that our supposition (f) is false. We may therefore conclude
            </P>
            <P>(k) God exists in reality.
            </P>
