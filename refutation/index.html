 <div class="answer" id="answer1">
     <p>My answer is yes, jesus needed to eat sleep rest and etc to survive but this however doesnt imply that he is not god. not at all. we know that jesus has 2 divine natures ( hypostatic union ) which is: </p>
     <p>Fully divine and Fully human. </p>
    <P>jesus in fully human nature has limitations and needs to rest sleep eat like  any else human does but in his divine nature he is fully god and has no limitations at all lets talk about what is hypostatic union, how jesus functioned and why doesnt his human nature affect the divine nature.</P>
    <P>INTRODUCTION:</P>
    <P>In the early centuries the Church contended with at least five major
        Christological heresies: (1). Arianism-which held thatJesus was a
        created being, the Son of God, but not eternal; (2). Ebionitism
        -which emphasized the humanity of Jesus at the expense of his
        deity; (3). Apollinarianism-which emphasized the deity of Christ
        at the expense of his humanity; (4). Nestorianism-which split
        Christ into two distinct persons, one human, one divine; (5).
        Eutychianism-which confused the two natures of Christ into one
        mixed nature of divine-human. The Council of Chalcedon
        (AD 451) has been traditionally recognized as the last word for the
        sake of established confessional dogma for orthodox Christology.
        Against Arianism, Apollinarianism, Nestorianism and Eutychianism
        this Council affirmed the full deity and full humanity of Jesus Christ.
        It declared that he was fully God and fully man in one person with
        two natures. The theological term used to label this relationship
        (coined by Cyril of Alexandria and accepted by the Council of
        Chalcedon) is the 'hypostatic union'.
        This Council may have stated ontologically what this union was,
        but the Church is still left with the difficulty of expressing how these
        two natures actually functioned practically in one person. How
        could Jesus function as a man who was God, or how could Jesus
        function as God who became a man? How did his two natures
        function in one person? This is a profound theological question to which I believe the New Testament provides sufficient revelation to
        fonnulate a clear answer.
         </P>
    <P>My presupposition is the view of the hypostatic union declared at
        the Council of Chalcedon-that Christ was fully God and fully
        human with two natures in one person. What I shall present are a
        number of New Testament passages which reveal how Jesus
        functioned while on earth as the God-man. Any and every
        interpretation must be arrived at through proper grammaticalhistorical-contextual inductive exegesis not previously governed by
        theological grids, constructs, or biases. Let the writers of the New
        Testament speak for themselves. I also presuppose that a multitude
        of Scriptures are available to prove the deity and humanity of Christ.
        I shall not rehearse the plethora of evidence (see, for example, In.
        1:1, 14; 8:58; Col. 2:9; 1 Tim. 2:5; and Heb. 1:3).
        </P>
    <P> Jesus Functioned as a Total Finite Man:</P>
    <P>I shall present passages which, on a grammatical-historical,
        contextual, exegetical reading, will show how Jesus functioned as a
        man. I shall seek to prove that whatever Jesus did, he as a nonnal
        healthy person functioned as a total finite man. We shall see aJesus
        who experienced human limitations because of the finiteness
        inherent in being human. The only exception is that he lived a sinIess
        human life-but this too will become a reality for Christians in the
        eternal state. As a man, Jesus, we shall obselVe, did not live as God
        nor out of the eternal attributes of God. This is not to say that he gave
        up or lost his dei1y or his attributes of dei1y. It is to say that in order to
        live afully human life,Jesus had by necessity to lay aside the exercise
        of the attributes of deity-the kind of attributes that are not
        characteristic of human beings (omniscience, omnipotence, and
        omnipresence). However, Jesus as a man was dependent on the
        Father's will and derived his power not from his own inherent deity
        but from the Holy Spirit. In this way he selVes as an accessible
        human model for his disciples. Let us investigate the New Testament
        evidence. I shall highlight the pertinent parts with italics. </P>
    <P>Mt. 20:21
        21 'What is it you want?' he asked.</P>
    <P>Mk. 5:9
        9 Then Jesus asked him, 'What is your name?
        </P>
    <P>Mk. 10:35-36
        35 ThenJames andJohn, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. 'Teacher,'
        they said, 'we want you to do for us whatever we ask.' 36 'What do you
        want me to do for you?' he asked. 
        </P>
    <P>These initial passages, on a plain unbiased contextual reading,
        show that Jesus demonstrated a limitation in his knowledge. He
        asked questions to secure information. It could be argued that where
        Jesus asked questions, he was not seeking information, but was
        merely drawing out matters for his purposes. I would argue that,
        unless we have contextual clues from the writer or from a parallel
        reference, the burden of proof lies with those who would suggest
        such an interpretation. </P>
    <P>There are, however, some teaching and discussion situations
        where this interpretation is valid. For example, on at least the
        occasion of the feeding of the 5,000 Jesus asked the question 'Where
        shall we buy bread for these people to eat?' John tells us: 'he asked
        this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to
        do' On. 6:5--6). This suggests, contextually, thatJesus was not asking
        a question for the purpose of receiving information, but was leading
        his disciples into a discovery of the miraculous that he intended to
        accomplish. In other words, Jesus was in this case drawing out
        matters for his own purposes and not asking for information. There
        is no good reason to presume this in Mt. 20:20-23, Mk. 5:1-10, and
        Mk. 10:35--40. </P>
        <P>Mk. 6:S-6
            He coulLl. not do any miracles there, except lay his hnds on a few sick
            people and heal them. And he was amazed at their lack of faith.</P>
        <P>This passage clearly states that Jesus was limited in his ability to
            do miracles--he could not do any miracles there except heal a few
            sick people. Matthew's redaction of Mark lightens the force. He
            states: 'And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack
            of faith' (Mt. 13:58). In both statements the absence of faith, in at
            least his home town, was a primary factor (d. Mk. 6:4, Mt. 13:57b).
            D. A. Carson comments on Matthew 13:58:</P>
        <P>Many say that v. 58 softens .... Mark 6:5-6. But two factors must be
            borne in mind: 1) Mark mentions some miracles, and Matthew,
            typically condensing, may be referring to these rather than commenting
            on Jesus' ability to do miracles; and 2) it is doubtful whether Mark's
            'could not' is ontological or absolute, for Mark records other miracles in
            which the beneficiaries exhibit no faith ... The 'could not' is related to
            Jesus' mission: just as Jesus could not turn stones to bread without
            violating his mission (4:1-4), so he could not do miracles indiscriminately without turning his mission into a sideshow. The 'lack offaith' ...</P>
        <P>The Hypostatic Union: How Didjesus Function?</P>
        <P>greatness of Jesus the Davidic King, Messiah, Teacher, and Son of
            God. Matthew concentrates onJesus as the fulfillment of major Old
            Testament prophecies, who, as the great Davidic promised One and
            Teacher gives five major discourses, and acts as the Son of God.
            Matthew pays more attention to the 'Son of God' theme much more
            than Mark does. It is not hard to see why Matthew (in 13:58) would
            redact Mark (at 6:5-6) to soften the force of the statement of Jesus'
            limitation. It does not fit his purpose. </P>
        <P>Furthermore, Dr. Carson's interpretation of the people's 'lack of
            faith' is read into not out of the text. In this text, there is no
            indication thatJesus was grieved or frustrated. If he was frustrated,
            would this not in fact show a limitation? The lack of faith did not
            strip him of power but rather limited his power as a man. Dr.
            Carson, it would appear, has committed some of the 'exegetical
            fallacies' that he has written about of others! He commits the fallacy
            'arising from omission of distanciation in the interpretive process'
            -this is reading one's theology into the text. He also creates
            'problems relating to juxtapositions of texts'-this is linking certain
            verses together and not others, thereby producing a grid that affects
            the interpretation of other texts." Matthew highlights the divine side
            (though not exclusively while Mark highlights the human side of
            Jesus (though not exclusively). Let Mark be understood in terms of
            what he intends as an author, and Matthew as well. Jesus, on a plain
            reading of Mark's account, could not do any miracles there. Jesus, on
            a plain reading of Matthew's account (and I would add, redaction of
            Mark), did not do any miracles there. That Jesus did not do any
            miracles because he could not are different perspectives of the
            historical account which presents no theological contradiction.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, how could Jesus be amazed at their lack of faith?
            This Greek word-thaumazo---means 'to wonder, marvel, be
            astonished'. A parallel usage of the word can be found in Matthew
            8:10 = Luke 7:9-when Jesus marvels at the faith of the Roman
            centurion where one would not expect faith. In Mark, he marvels at
            the lack offaith where he had a right to expect it. We would ask the
            question: how could one exercising divine omniscience ever be
            astonished or amazed at anything? Clearly,Jesus the man is depicted
            as limited in Mk. 6:5-6. </P>
        <P>Mt. 24:36 (c£. Mk. 13:3.2)
             </P>
        <P>No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven,
            nor the Son, but only the Father.'</P>
        <P>These parallel passages are indisputable in affirming that the Son was limited in his knowledge about perhaps the most important
            truth regarding his second coming-when it would take place! If
            God knows all thing&-past, present, and future-then something is
            here being revealed about the limitations of Christ's humanity. It is
            non-sense for Jesus to simultaneously know as God but not know as
            man about the day or hour of his return. If we argue that this is
            possible, then we are left with aJesus who has a split personality,
            one human, one divine-and this is the heresy ofNestorianism.Jesus
            functioned as one persoIl-one hwnan person, limited in knowledge
            of the past, present, and future. </P>
        <P>Mk. 5:30-32</P>
        <P>30 At onceJesus realized that power had gone outfrom him. He turned
            around in the crowd and asked, 'Who touched my clothes?' 31 'You see
            the people crowding against you,' his disciples answered, 'and yet you
            can ask, "Who touched me?" , 32 But Jesus kept looking around to see
            who had done it  </P>
        <P>One could argue thatJesus is here 'playing dumb' in order to draw
            out the woman, bring attention to her healing, and thus glorifY God.
            However, three observations easily dismantle any such possibility:
            (1). how can an intentional divine attribute of omnipotent omniscience ever realize that power had gone out from him--or for that
            matter realize anything? The Greek word here (epigrwus means 'to
            notice, perceive, learn of, to perceive something (on oneself)';
            (2). the fact thatJesus kept looking around shows that he did not
            know who it was in the throng of the crowd; (3). ifhe was drawing
            the woman out he could (we would assume from his omniscience)
            have singled her out of the crowd--an even greater display of divine
            attributes! A plain unbiased reading can only yield the conclusion
            that Jesus and the disciples were unaware of the identity of the
            woman who touched him. </P>
            
        <P>Mk. 7:24 </P>
        <P>Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of'I)Te. He entered a house
            and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence
            secret. </P>
        <P>If we argue thatJesus as the God-man enjoyed all the attributes of
            deity then why could he not keep his presence secret? The
            assumption is that this is what he desired. The Greek is even clear, he
            was rwt able to escape notice. </P>
        <P>THE DIVINE NATURE OF JESUS CHRIST:</P>
        <P>sermon on Peter’s walking on water (Matt. 14:22–33) that included this point: As long as Peter kept His eyes on Jesus, he was all right. Only when he took his eyes off the Lord did he start to sink.</P>
        <P>That lesson applies not only to individuals but also to the church. When the church loses its focus on the person and work of Christ, it will quickly fall into darkness. Christianity is all about Christ, who He is and what He has done. Thus, if we make the focus of the church a particular political program, a sociocultural ideology, or even the church itself, we ultimately end up with no Christianity at all.
        </P>
        <P>One of the great accomplishments of the Reformation was its returning the church’s focus to Christ. We could, in fact, say that the driving force of the Reformation was bringing the church back to its historic confession of Christ alone (solus Christus)—Christ alone is head of the church; Christ alone is worthy of adoration; Christ alone saves.
        </P>
        <P>In seeking to recover the person and work of Christ, Protestants, particularly the Reformed, were not seeking to break new ground with respect to our Lord’s person. They only wanted to see historic Christian orthodoxy as represented in such statements as the Definition of Chalcedon taught clearly and without compromise. Protestants asserted with Chalcedon that Jesus is one person who possesses two natures, a divine nature and a human nature.
        </P>
        <P>A nature is that which makes something what it is, those attributes that define it. For example, the divine nature is marked by divine attributes such as omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, self-existence, eternity, and so on. To have a divine nature is to possess all the attributes that make God who He is. Thus, when we say that Jesus has a divine nature, we are saying that He possesses every attribute that God possesses in His divine nature. He is truly God.
        </P>
        <P>Christ’s possession of the divine nature is taught directly in passages such as John 1:1–18. We can also look to episodes in our Lord’s life that reveal His divine nature to us. In today’s passage, for example, Jesus creates life, raising a young girl from the dead, simply by commanding her to live (Mark 5:21–43). That is something only God can do, for He created life by speaking it into existence (Gen. 1). Another passage that reveals Jesus’ possession of the divine nature is John 1:43–51. Here we see evidence of omniscience, as Jesus tells Nathanael that he was sitting under a fig tree before our Lord encountered him.</P>

 <div class="question-text">"the book of ibn taymiyyah debunks christianity"</div>
 <div class="answer-toggle" data-target="#answer3">See answer</div>
 <div class="answer" id="answer3">
 <P>The answer to say simply is No, ibn taymiyyah didnt debunk christianity with his book, lets refute his book throughly and discuss together on why is he false and if he did infact debunk christianity</P>
 <P>First introduction to who he was:</P>
 <P>Shaikhul-Islam Ibn Taimiyah, one of the greatest Muslim Scholars ever, spent his entire life defending the religion of Allah at all levels. Among such areas was his concern to respond to the followers of other religions, both refuting their allegations about Islam and highlighting the aspects of corruption in their creeds.</P>
 <P>In this area, Ibn Taimiyah wrote a number of works among which Al-Jawab As-Sahih Li-man Baddala Dina Al- Masih (Answering Those Who Altered the Religion of Jesus Christ) is a basic reference. Other books included: Ar-Radd 'ala al-Nasara (Answering the Christians); Takhjil Ahl Al-Injil (Refuting the Allegations of the People of the Gospel); and Al-Risalah Al-Qubrusiyah (Answering the Cyprus Message).</P>
 <P>So lets start with his arguments, what does he say and what reasoning does he have for it.? ibn taymiyyah says:</P>
 <P>"For example, the modern day crusaders declared their purpose publicly, which is to convert the Islamic world into Christianity. They do not hide their enmity toward Islam."</P>
 <P>But this is simply not true. muslims started many wars before the first crusade : </P>
 <P>The Islamic conquest of Persia (633-656 CE): The Rashidun Caliphate, led by Caliph Umar, conquered the Sassanian Empire, which led to the spread of Islam in the region.</P>
 <P>The Islamic conquest of North Africa (647-709 CE): The Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates conquered the Byzantine territories in North Africa, leading to the establishment of Islamic rule in the region.</P>
 <P>The Battle of Tours (732 CE): The Umayyad Caliphate, led by Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi, invaded Gaul (modern-day France) but was defeated by the Frankish Kingdom, led by Charles Martel.</P>
 <P>The Islamic conquest of Spain (711-718 CE): The Umayyad Caliphate, led by Tariq ibn Ziyad, conquered the Visigothic Kingdom, leading to the establishment of Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula.</P>
 <P>The Byzantine-Arab Wars (634-1180 CE): A series of conflicts between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun, Umayyad, and Abbasid Caliphates, which led to the loss of Byzantine territories in the Middle East and North Africa.</P>
<P>The Crusades: A Response to Islamic Aggression 
</P>
<P>One of the most potent myths of our age is that the Crusades were little more than an
   unprovoked attack by a barbarous Europe against a quiescent and cultured Islamic
   world. According to conventional ideas, the seventh and eighth centuries constitute
   the great age of Islamic expansion. By the eleventh century - the time of the First
   Crusade - we are told that the Islamic world was quiescent and settled and that, by
   implication, the Crusaders were the aggressors. Indeed, the Crusaders are routinely
   portrayed as a horde of barbarians from a backward and superstitious Europe
   irrupting into the cultured and urbane world of the eleventh century Near East. 
   </P>
<P>This at least is the populist language often employed on television and in newspaper
   articles. In my recent book Holy Warriors: Islam and the Demise of Classical
   Civilization, I have shown however that before the advent of Islam Christians had no
   concept of "Holy War" at all, and that it was from the Muslims themselves that
   Europeans took this idea. I showed too that the Crusades, far from being an
   unprovoked act of aggression on the part of Christian Europe, were part of a
   rearguard action aimed at stemming the Muslim advance which, by the start of the
   eleventh century, was threatening as never before to overwhelm the whole of Europe.
   Notwithstanding the evidence presented in Holy Warriors, the consensus, until very
   recent times at least, among the majority of medieval historians is that the threat from
   Islam had very little, if anything, to do with the Crusades; the Muslims were simply
   the convenient targets of a savage and brutal Europe, mired in a culture of habitual
   violence and rapine. It is true that this picture is now coming under attack, as for
   example the recent comments of Bernard Lewis illustrate. In Lewis' words:
   "We are now expected to believe that the Crusades were an unwarranted act
   of aggression against a peaceful Muslim world. Hardly. The first call for a
   crusade occurred in 846 CE, when an Arab expedition to Sicily sailed up the
   Tiber and sacked St Peter's in Rome. A synod in France issued an appeal to
   Christian sovereigns to rally against 'the enemies of Christ,' and the pope, Leo
   IV, offered a heavenly reward to those who died fighting the Muslims. A
   century and a half and many battles later, in 1096, the Crusaders actually
   arrived in the Middle East. The Crusades were a late, limited, and
   unsuccessful imitation of the jihad - an attempt to recover by holy war what 
   was lost by holy war. It failed, and it was not followed up." (Bernard Lewis,
   2007 Irving Kristol Lecture, March 7). 
   </P>
<P>The same line has also been taken by a small group of other writers, most notably by
   Thomas F. Madden, who argues that the prevailing view of the Crusaders as early
   European colonialists (barbarous colonialists) is one that owes far more to modern
   American and European anti-colonialist prejudices than to the facts of history.
   Madden too emphasizes the defensive nature of the Crusades and is extremely critical
   of those historians who fail to see this. (See Madden's "Crusade Propaganda" article
   and book on the Crusades)
   Notwithstanding these voices of dissent, the view that yet prevails in popular culture
   and indeed in academia is of an advanced, cultured and urbane Islamic civilization
   subjected to an almost entirely unprovoked attack by a backward and semi-barbarous
   Europe. This is the view, for example, expressed in David Levering Lewis' recently
   published, God's Crucible: Islam and the making of Europe, 570-1215, and it is one
   that is predicated upon the belief - still almost universally held - that for centuries
   (during the so-called "Dark Ages") Europe was a semi-literate and semi-savage
   backwater, a cultural graveyard mired in poverty, brutality and illiteracy.
   For David Lewis, as for academia in general, the impact of Islam upon Europe was
   entirely beneficent; for it was precisely during Europe's Dark Age that Islam
   experienced its Golden Age - three centuries during which Islam led the world in
   terms of culture and learning. According to this view, which yet remains the default
   one, Classical Civilization was terminated in the 5th
    century by the arrival of the
   Barbarian tribes from Germany and Central Asia (Goths, Vandals, Huns, etc), and it
   was only the timely arrival of the Muslims on the scene, during the 7th
    century, that
   preserved any of the learning of the Classical world at all. It was from the Muslims,
   so the story goes, that in the 10th
    and 11th
    centuries primitive Europeans
   "rediscovered" Classical learning and set out on the long road that led to the
   Renaissance.</P>
<P>It will be obvious that as long as this narrative holds sway, the Crusaders, for all the
   protestations of Bernard Lewis and Thomas Madden, will continue to be seen as
   aggressive savages. Yet the antidote to such ideas had already been provided in the
   1930s, when Belgian historian Henri Pirenne found that Classical Civilization did not
   die as a result of the Barbarian Invasions of the 5th
    century, and that the same literate
   and urban civilization continued to flourish in the West - under Germanic kings -
   until the arrival of Islam in the 7th
    century. Pirenne showed that it was actually 
    Islam's blockade of the Mediterranean, mainly through piracy, which impoverished
the West and led to the abandonment of cities and the loss of literacy. Thus, for
Pirenne, Islam caused the Dark Age, it did not end it. 
</P>
<P>Pirenne's work has been fiercely criticized and his conclusions on the whole rejected
   and discarded - especially in the English-speaking world. My own work, which seeks
   a complete reassessment of the history of Islam's and Christendom's interaction,
   concentrates primarily on a defense of Pirenne, whom I believe offered us the key to a
   proper understanding of the Medieval world. For the present, however, I wish to add
   my own voice to that of such historians as Madden and Bernard Lewis, who have
   now called for a fundamental reconsideration of the Crusading phenomenon.
   As noted above, to generations of historians raised on the belief that a European Dark
   Age coincided with a Muslim Golden Age, the Crusades, coming at the end of that
   Golden Age, represent little more than a stark illustration of European backwardness
   and savagery. The "energies" of Europe's warrior-class, it is held, were simply
   directed by the Papacy away from internal destruction onto the convenient targets of
   the Islamic world. This is the line of reasoning taken by Marcus Bull in his
   examination of the origins of the Crusades in The Oxford History of the Crusades. In
   an article of almost 10,000 words, Bull fails to consider the Muslim threat at all.
   Indeed he mentions it only to dismiss it:
   "The perspective of a Mediterranean-wide struggle [between Islam and
   Christianity] was visible only to those institutions, in particular the papacy,
   which had the intelligence networks, grasp of geography, and sense of long
   historical tradition to take a broad overview of Christendom and its threatened
   predicament, real or supposed. This is a point which needs to be emphasized
   because the terminology of the crusades is often applied inaccurately to all the
   occasions in the decades before 1095 when Christians and Muslims found
   themselves coming to blows. An idea which underpins the imprecise usage is
   that the First Crusade was the last in, and the culmination of, a series of wars
   in the eleventh century which had been crusading in character, effectively
   'trial runs' which had introduced Europeans to the essential features of the
   crusade. This is an untenable view." (Bull, p. 19)
   With what justification, we might ask, does Bull dissociate the earlier ChristianMuslim conflicts of the 11th
    century in Spain, Sicily, and Anatolia from the First
   Crusade? The answer can hardly be described as convincing. "There is plenty of
   evidence," he says, "to suggest that people regarded Pope Urban II's crusade appeal  of 1095-6 as something of a shock to the communal system: it was felt to be effective
   precisely because it was different from anything attempted before." (Ibid.)</P>
<P>Of course it was different — the Pope had called a meeting of all the potentates and
   prelates of Europe to urge the assembly of a mighty force to march to Constantinople
   and eventually to retake the Holy Land. It was new because of its scale and its
   ambition. But to thus dismiss the connection with what went before in Spain and
   Sicily - and Anatolia - is ridiculous. Such a statement can only derive from a mindset
   which somehow has to see the Crusaders as the aggressors and to thereby detach them
   from the legitimate defensive wars which Christians had been fighting in Spain and
   throughout the Mediterranean in the decades immediately preceding 1095.
   The fact is, in the 20 years before the First Crusade, Christendom had lost the whole
   of Anatolia, an area greater than France, and a region right on the doorstep of Europe.
   In 1050 the Seljuk leader, Togrul Beg, undertook Holy War against the Christians of
   Anatolia, who had thus far resisted the power of the Caliphs. We are told that 130,000
   Christians died in the war, but that, upon Togrul Beg's death in 1063, the Christians
   reasserted their independence and freedom. This was however to be of short duration,
   and no sooner had Togrul Beg's nephew, Alp Arslan, been proclaimed Sultan than
   the war was renewed.
   In 1064 the old Armenian capital of Ani was destroyed; and the prince of Kars, the
   last independent Armenian ruler, "gladly handed over his lands to the [Byzantine]
   Emperor in return for estates in the Taurus mountains. Large numbers of Armenians
   accompanied him to his new home." (Runciman, p. 61) Indeed, at this time, the entire
   Armenian nation was effectively transplanted hundreds of miles to the south and
   west.
   But the Turkish attacks continued. From 1065 onwards the great frontier-fortress of
   Edessa was assaulted yearly. In 1066 they occupied the pass of the Amanus
   Mountains, and next spring they sacked the Cappadocian metropolis of Caesarea.
   Next winter the Byzantine armies were defeated at Melitene and Sebastea. These
   victories gave Alp Arslan control of all Armenia, and a year later he raided far into
   the Empire, to Neocaesarea and Amorium in 1068, to Iconium in 1069, and in 1070 to
   Chonae, near the Aegean coast. (Ibid.) 
   </P>
<P>These events make it perfectly clear that the Turks now threatened all the of Empire's
   Asian possessions, with the position of Constantinople herself increasingly insecure.
   The imperial government was forced to take action. Constantine X, whose neglect of the army was largely responsible for the catastrophes which now overwhelmed the
   Empire, had died in 1067, leaving a young son, Michael VII under the regency of the
   Empress-mother Eudocia. The next year, Eudocia married the commander-in-chief,
   Romanus Diogenes, who was raised to the throne.
   Romanus was a distinguished soldier and a sincere patriot, who saw that the safety of
   the Empire depended on the rebuilding of the army and ultimately the re-conquest of
   Armenia. (Ibid.) Within four months of his accession, Romanus had gathered a large
   but unreliable force and set out to meet the foe. "In three laborious campaigns,"
   writes Gibbon, "the Turks were driven beyond the Euphrates; in the fourth, and last,
   Romanus undertook the deliverance of Armenia." (Gibbon, Ch. 57) Here however, at
   the seminal battle of Manzikert (1071), he was defeated and captured and all of
   Anatolia was irretrievably lost.
   Any honest reading of these events leaves us in no doubt whatsoever that the
   aggressor was Alp Arslan and his Turks, and that Romanus Diogenes' march into
   Armenia was a last-ditch counterattack by the Byzantines to prevent the loss of all of
   Anatolia. Yet observe how the battle is described in the recently-published Chambers
   Dictionary of World History. "The Byzantine Emperor, Romanus IV Diogenes
   (1068/71), tried to extend his empire into Armenia but was defeated at Manzikert near
   Lake Van by the Seljuk Turks under Alp Arslan (1063/72), who then launched a fullscale invasion of Anatolia." (Lenman (ed.) p. 585)
   We see in the above a graphic example of the disinformation disseminated by the
   mentality of political correctness, where the victim is transformed into the aggressor
   and the aggressor portrayed as the victim.
   Alp Arslan was killed a year later, and the conquest of Asia Minor, virtually all that
   was left of Byzantium's Asiatic possessions, was completed by his son Malek Shah
   (1074-1084). These conquests left the Turks in possession of the fortress of Nicaea,
   on the southern shore of the Sea of Marmara, putting the survival of Constantinople
   in question.
   These then are the major political events which prefigured the First Crusade. Within a
   space of 35 years the Turks had seized control of Christian territories larger than the
   entire area of France, and they now were a real threat to Europe. We are accustomed
   to think of the Crusades as first and foremost an attempt by Christians to retake the
   Holy Land and Jerusalem; but this is a mistake. Byzantine Emperor Alexius
   Comnenus then made his famous plea to the Pope, not to free Jerusalem, but to drive  the Turks from his door and to liberate the huge Christian territories in Asia Minor
   that had so recently been devastated and annexed by the followers of the crescent. 
   </P>
<P>It is true, of course, that the Turks, who had also assumed control of Syria/Palestine,
   also imposed a barbarous regime in that region; and that the sufferings of Christian
   pilgrims, as well as native Christian populations in that region, described so vividly
   by Peter the Hermit and others, provided a powerful emotional impetus to the
   Crusading movement among ordinary Europeans. However, the relief of pilgrims was
   not - to begin with at least - the primary goal of the Crusaders. Nonetheless, the
   barbarous nature of the Turkish actions in Palestine was a microcosm of their
   behavior throughout the Christian regions that they conquered, and the nature of their
   rule in the entire Near East is described thus by Gibbon in his usual vivid manner:
   "The Oriental Christians and the Latin pilgrims deplored a revolution, which,
   instead of the regular government and old alliance of the caliphs, imposed on
   their necks the iron yoke of the strangers of the north. In his court and camp
   the great sultan had adopted in some degree the arts and manners of Persia;
   but the body of the Turkish nation, and more especially the pastoral tribes,
   still breathed the fierceness of the desert. From Nicaea to Jerusalem, the
   western countries of Asia were a scene of foreign and domestic hostility; and
   the shepherds of Palestine, who held a precarious sway on a doubtful frontier,
   had neither leisure nor capacity to await the slow profits of commercial and
   religious freedom. The pilgrims, who, through innumerable perils, had
   reached the gates of Jerusalem, were the victims of private rapine or public
   oppression, and often sunk under the pressure of famine and disease, before
   they were permitted to salute the holy sepulcher. A spirit of native barbarism,
   or recent zeal, prompted the Turkmans to insult the clergy of every sect; the
   patriarch was dragged by the hair along the pavement and cast into a dungeon,
   to extort a ransom from the sympathy of his flock; and the divine worship in
   the church of the Resurrection was often disturbed by the savage rudeness of
   its masters." (Chapter 57)
   The ordinary peasants of Europe may not have been fully cognizant of the danger
   from the east, but the ruling classes and the Church could not have been anything but
   alarmed. Yet even if the peasantry and artisans of Europe knew little about Anatolia,
   they would certainly have had some knowledge of the Muslim threat. It is Marcus
   Bull's suggestion that they did not, which is untenable. The advances of Abd erRahman III and Al-Mansur through northern Spain in the latter years of the 10 century would have sent a flood of Christian refugees into southern France; and the
   raids even into southern France which continued well into the 11th
    century would
   have sent refugees from there fleeing into central and northern France. These people
   would have spread knowledge of the danger throughout Western Europe. </P>
<P>Granted, peasants and manual laborers would have had a very imperfect
   understanding of Islam and what Muslims actually believed; but that is not the point:
   They knew enough to know that Muslims were enemies of Christ; that they waged
   war against non-combatants and enslaved women and children, and that they had
   conquered all of Spain and threatened France.
   And this is a point that needs to be stressed repeatedly: The reality is that, far from
   being quiescent and peaceful, by the latter years of the 10th
    century, Islam was once
   again on the march. Muslim armies waged wars of conquest against non-believers
   from one end of the Islamic world to the other; from Spain in the west to India in the
   east; and this new aggression was not confined to the eastern and western extremities,
   but proceeded along the entire length of Islam's borders.
   The Christian kingdoms of Armenia, Georgia and Byzantium were threatened with
   extinction, and Muslim armies fought with Christians in Sicily and other
   Mediterranean lands. Many aspects of this new Islamic thrust, particularly those
   which occurred around the beginning of the 11th
    century in Spain and India, are
   strangely reminiscent of the earlier Islamic expansion in the 8th
    century, so
   reminiscent indeed that they might even cause the casual observer to wonder whether
   the birth of Islam has been somehow misdated and moved into the past by several
   centuries.
   So, for example, we are told that the main Islamic invasion of India began with the
   conquests of Mahmud of Ghazni, a Turkic-speaking prince based in Afghanistan,
   who launched a series of 17 campaigns into Northern India. These began in 1001 and
   ended in 1026, just four years or so before his death; a series of campaigns, we should
   note, that caused immense destruction and loss of life in the country. By the 1020s,
   Mahmud ruled an empire that included much of the Indus Valley, Afghanistan and
   Persia. Yet these conquests, at the start of the 11th
    century, seem to echo those of
   Muhammed bin Qasim, three centuries earlier, who created an Islamic Empire in
   roughly the same region (circa 710).  It is strange too that Mahmud of Ghazni's name differs but little from that of his
   predecessor. Only the "n" in Ghazni differentiates it from Qasim, a word which could
   equally well be written as Qasmi.
   In the western end of the Islamic world we encounter the same phenomenon. "In the
   10th
    century," says Runciman, "the Moslems of Spain represented a very real threat to
   Christendom." (p. 89) Under Abd er-Rahman III (912-961) the followers of
   Muhammad found a leader who promised to repeat the successes of the eighth
   century. As founder of the Cordoba Caliphate, he presided over a new age of splendor
   and military power. His forces battled the Christians to the north, and the boundary
   between the two religions was marked by the battles he fought. The most decisive of
   these were at Simancas (939), between Salamanca and Valladolid on the Duoro
   River, where he was stopped. These were areas that had been overrun by the Muslims
   two centuries earlier, though the Christians had apparently retaken them in the
   interim.
   In many ways then Abd er-Rahman III resembles his ancestor and namesake Abd erRahman I, who conquered these areas in the 8th
    century. And this new conquering
   impulse continued under Al-Mansur (980-1002), whose career was to see Muslim
   power once again enveloping all of Spain, including the far north. He burned Leon,
   Barcelona, and Santiago de Compostela, and, copying his Muslim predecessors
   almost three centuries earlier, advanced over the Pyrenees. We are told that in AlMansur's time, "Never had the Christians found themselves in such a critical
   position." (Bertrand, p. 57)
   It was the attacks of Al-Mansur that finally roused Christian Europe into undertaking
   the Reconquista, which commenced with the campaigns of Sancho III (called the
   Great) of Navarre and the Norman Baron Roger de Tony in the 1020s. Yet these
   events recall the earlier beginning of the Reconquista with the victory of Don Pelayo
   at Covadonga around 718.
   you might wonder why this "revival" of Islamic conquest in the 11th
   century seems so uncannily to resemble the Islamic conquests of the 7th
    and 8th
   centuries. That indeed is a moot point: one to be discussed in a future article. For the
   moment, all that needs to be emphasized is that, contrary to popular belief, the 10th
   and 11th
    centuries constitute a period of massive expansion by Islam, an expansion
   felt all along Islam's boundary with Christendom. The Crusades were clearly part of
   an attempt to stem this aggression. 
   </P>
 <P>So his claim isnt true. starting off his book he lies about the fact that crusaders were animals towards muslims and he tried to claim that crusades happened without a reason  and that it was just to destroy islam but this isnt true because the crusade was a legitimate justified act against muslims try to make the whole world muslim and convert by force which is actually haram.</P>
 <P>Second he claims that his arguments will be undisputable :  </P>
 <P>"This motivated me to write a reply to it, which
    would be the undisputable, definite and right answer that
    aims at clarifying the the truth and setting it apart from
    falsehood, in order that those who have sound judgment
    would make use of it"</P>
 <P> but it appears to us that his arguments were really not undisputable, as we today will humble him and refute his arguments.</P>
 <P>But lets start off the claims of christians and ibn taymiyyahs " refutation. The claims of christians:</P>
 <P>The writer related that the Bishop said, “They (the people
    of the island) say, ‘We have heard that a man from
    amongst the Arabs named Muhammad claims that he is
    the Messenger of Allah and that he has been sent with a
    Book (Qur’an) which, he claims, was revealed to him from
    Allah.’” He continued, “If you have already, as I see,
    acknowledged that Book and Messenger, and you have
    exerted your ultimate efforts to study and comprehend it,
    why have you not followed him, Muhammad the
    Messenger? What has prevented you from believing in
    this Book (Qur’an), especially when it is mentioned that
    this Book states,</P>
 <P>which means, “And whoever seeks a religion other than
    Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the
    Hereafter he will be one of the losers.” (Al-'lmran, 3: 85)</P>
 <P>They replied, “We did not believe in this Book or in that
    Messenger for several reasons.” He asked, “And what are those reasons?" They replied, “The first reason is that this
    Book (Qur’an) is revealed in Arabic and not in our mother
    tongue as stated in its verses</P>
 <P>they said, “Verily, as far as justice is concerned, the
    judgment in that verse is confined to those people (Arabs)
    to whom Islam was sent, but no other nation is referred to
    in those words. It is taken for granted that Allah is just
    and thus, it is not becoming of His Justice that He would
    order a nation to follow a man (i.e. a messenger) without
    sending a book in their language with him. Therefore, that
    Messenger, who was sent with the Arabic book is sent
    only to the Arabs.”
    </P>
 <P>These are their very words in the first chapter, in which
 they did not tackle the issue of believing or disbelieving in
 the Qur’an. They only claimed that it was not sent to
 them, but was sent for the pagan Arabs and so, according
 to reason, it cannot be sent to them</P>
 <P>Ibn taymiyyahs "refutation":</P>
 <P>One: The Unsoundness of the Christians'
    Argumentation in Which they Refer to Reports about
    the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him):</P>
 <P>The argumentation of the Christians in which they refer
    to reports about the Prophet (peace be upon him) as well
    as the way in which they seek arguments in the verses of
    the Qur’an, are invalid; for the Qur’an is a plea against
    them and not for them. In addition, the Books revealed to
    the early Prophets and which they used in their plea are,
    in fact, against them and their claims, even if Muhammad
    had not been sent. However the undeniable truth is that
    the book with which Muhammad (peace be upon him)
    came is in accordance with all the words and teachings
    of the previous Prophets (peace be upon them all) as
    regards annulling their false religious beliefs such as:
    trinity, unification, etc. Reason contradicts such claims as
    well.
    </P>
 <P>We further assert that neither the message with which the
    Prophet (peace be upon him) was sent along with that of
    all the other Prophets prove any of their claims, nor does
    reason. On the contrary, the message of Muhammad
    (peace be upon him) and those of the Prophets, obviously
    and plainly state the invalidity of their proofs, and,
    furthermore, it presents clear proofs exposing the
    corruption of Christian beliefs.</P>
 <P>It is not acceptable from anyone who does not believe in
    Muhammad (peace be upon him), and nor even in a
    single word of that with which he was sent, to use his (i.e.,
    Muhammad’s) words and traditions in his plea. Using the
    words of those who are not Prophets is, to some extent,
    understandable, for some of their words may assert their</P>
 <P>claims while some others may not. However, the sayings
    of the Prophets should be taken as a whole, and should
    be entirely accepted or left. It is not acceptable to believe
    in some of them and deny the rest as that contradicts their
    belief.
    </P>
 <P>Similarly, using verses of the Qur’an by Christians to
    prove a certain point of view can never be acceptable, for
    they select what they think proves their point and
    abandons that which annuls their point.
    </P>
 <P>On the contrary, Muslims can use traditions and the
    words of the Prophets as well as their Books with which
    they were sent in their argument with Christians and
    Jews; for Muslims believe in and accept the prophethood
    and truthfulness of the messages of Musa (Moses), Isa
    (Jesus), Dawud (David), Sulaiman (Solomon) and all
    other Prophets (peace be upon them all). According to the
    Islamic creed, a Muslim must believe in all the Books
    revealed by Allah and in every Prophet or Messenger sent
    by Him. This is one of the bases of Islam. Furthermore, if
    a Muslim disbelieves in any of the Prophets sent by Allah
    or the Books revealed by Him, he will be considered a
    disbeliever. Any Muslim who dares even to despise one of
    the Prophets is considered a disbeliever and his blood is
    lawful according to Islamic law (i.e., that is the legal
    penalty for despising the Prophets;) as Allah, the
    Almighty states</P>
 <P>which means, “The Messenger (Muhammad) believes in
    what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so
    do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels,
    His Books, and His Messengers. They say, ‘We make no
    distinction between one another of His Messengers’ - and
    they say, ‘We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your
    Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).’”
    (Al-Baqarah, 2:285)</P>
 <P>So by this text we see that ibn taymiyyah " refutes" christians by saying following arguments : </P>
 <P>1) Christians shouldnt use the verses of quran the way they do as the quran pleas against them, not for them</P>
 <P>2) the very claims of christians contradict themselves</P>
 <P>3)using quran verses to prove a point by christians isnt accaptable as they use  the stuff they believe in not what is actually in the quran </P>
 <P>4) if christians use certain verses of quran then they should believe in the quran by whole</P>
 <P>my answer to the first argument :</P>
 <P>my answer on this is yes, i agree that quran pleas against them but not for them but what kind of logic is that? take for example there was  a book in which i didnt believe in but you did, i read the book and try to pinpoint the contradictions of the book: " the verse 1:1 says p1 but the verse 36:5 says p2 thus its a contradiction " but you say to me " you cant pinpoint such contradictions as the book is against u, not for u " this is simply invalid. sure we dont believe in the quran and surely the quran is against us, not for us but this doesnt mean we cant pinpoint certain contradictions of the quran. same way that ibn tayimiyyah doesnt believe in christianity but pinpoints the " Contradictions " in it ( galatians 1:8) so ibn taymiyyah simply contradicts himself here as he raises " contradictcions " later in the book.</P>
 <P>my answer to the second argument :</P>
 <P>Firstly ibn taymiyyah really didnt point out any reason on why the christians contradicted themselves but the christians really didnt contradict themselves as the quran states in tons of more verses that  Prophet Muhammad  was primarily sent to the Arabs of the Pre-Islamic era, known as the Jahiliyyah period. this is stated in the following verses:</P>
 <P>In Sahih Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 1, Hadith 3, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have said, "I have been sent to the white and black people, the Arabs and the non-Arabs, and the nomads and the urban people, and the Persians and the Byzantines, and the Chinese and the Indians, and the people of the East and the West."</P>
 <P>+ ibn taymiyyah said theres no contradictions in quran and tried to refute it but lets refute him on that:</P>
 <P>CONTRADICTIONS IN QURAN</P>
 <P>Gods Words do Change:
   [an-Nahl 16:101] And when We put a revelation in place of (another) revelation, - and Allah knoweth best what He revealeth- they say: Lo! thou art but inventing. Most of them know not.
   [al-Baqarah 2:106] Nothing of our revelation (even a single verse) do we abrogate or cause be forgotten, but we bring (in place) one better or the like thereof. Knowest thou not that Allah is Able to do all things ?
   [ar-Ra`d 13:39] Allah effaceth what He will, and establisheth (what He will), and with Him is the source of ordinance. 
   </P>
 <P>Gods Words don't Change:
   [Yunus 10:64] Theirs are good tidings in the life of the world and in the Hereafter - There is no changing the Words of Allah - that is the Supreme Triumph.
   [al-Kahf 18:27] And recite that which hath been revealed unto thee of the Scripture of thy Lord. There is none who can change His words, and thou wilt find no refuge beside Him.
   [al-Hijr 15:9] Lo! We, even We, reveal the Reminder, and lo! We verily are its Guardian. </P>
 <P>This can also prove that the bible isn't corrupted, for it is word of Allah,
   Say, “O people of the Book, you have nothing to stand on, unless you uphold the Torah and the Injīl and what has been sent down to you from your Lord.” What has been sent down to you from your Lord will certainly make many of them more persistent in rebellion and disbelief. So, do not grieve over the disbelieving people.</P>
 <P>God's day is 1000 years:
   [as-Sajdah 32:5] He directeth the ordinance from the heaven unto the earth; then it ascendeth unto Him in a Day, whereof the measure is a thousand years of that ye reckon.</P>
 <P>God's day is 50000 years:
   [al-Ma`arij 70:4] (Whereby) the angels and the Spirit ascend unto Him in a Day whereof the span is fifty thousand years</P>
 <P>There is no intercessor:
   [az-Zumar 39:44] Say: Unto Allah belongeth all intercession. His is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. And afterward unto Him ye will be brought back.</P>
 <P>[as-Sajdah 32:4] Allah it is Who created the heavens and the earth, and that which is between them, in six Days. Then He mounted the Throne. Ye have not, beside Him, a protecting friend or mediator {intercessor}. Will ye not then remember ?</P>
 <P>There is an intercessor:
   [Yunus 10:3] Lo! your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, then He established Himself upon the Throne, directing all things. There is no intercessor (with Him) save after His permission. That is Allah, your Lord, so worship Him. Oh, will ye not remind?</P>
 <P>Multiple angels spoke to Mary:
   [Ali-Imran 3:42] And ˹remember˺ when the angels said, “O Mary! Surely Allah has selected you, purified you, and chosen you over all women of the world.
   
   [Ali-Imran 3:45] ˹Remember˺ when the angels proclaimed, “O Mary! Allah gives you good news of a Word from Him, his name will be the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary; honoured in this world and the Hereafter, and he will be one of those nearest ˹to Allah˺.</P>
 <P>One angel spoke to Mary:
   [Maryam 19:17-25] screening herself off from them. Then We sent to her Our angel, ˹Gabriel,˺ appearing before her as a man, perfectly formed. She appealed, “I truly seek refuge in the Most Compassionate from you! ˹So leave me alone˺ if you are God-fearing.” He responded, “I am only a messenger from your Lord, ˹sent˺ to bless you with a pure son.” She wondered, “How can I have a son when no man has ever touched me, nor am I unchaste?” He replied, “So will it be! Your Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me. And so will We make him a sign for humanity and a mercy from Us.’ It is a matter ˹already˺ decreed.” So she conceived him and withdrew with him to a remote place. Then the pains of labour drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She cried, “Alas! I wish I had died before this, and was a thing long forgotten!” So a voice reassured her from below her, “Do not grieve! Your Lord has provided a stream at your feet. And shake the trunk of this palm tree towards you, it will drop fresh, ripe dates upon you.</P>
 <P>What was man created from: blood, clay, dust, or nothing?
   “Created man, out of a (mere) clot of congealed blood,” (96:2).
   “We created man from sounding clay, from mud moulded into shape, (15:26).
   “The similitude of Jesus before Allah is as that of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him: “Be”. And he was,” (3:59).
   “But does not man call to mind that We created him before out of nothing?” (19:67, Yusuf Ali). Also, 52:35).
   “He has created man from a sperm-drop; and behold this same (man) becomes an open disputer! (16:4).</P>
 <P>Is there or is there not compulsion in religion according to the Qur’an?
   “Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things,” (2:256).
   “And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger, to the people (assembled) on the day of the Great Pilgrimage, – that Allah and His Messenger dissolve (treaty) obligations with the Pagans. If then, ye repent, it were best for you; but if ye turn away, know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah. And proclaim a grievous penalty to those who reject Faith,” (9:3).
   “But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practice regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful,” (9:5).
   Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued,” (9:29).</P>
 <P>The first Muslim was Muhammad? Abraham? Jacob? Moses?
   “And I [Muhammad] am commanded to be the first of those who bow to Allah in Islam,” (39:12).
   “When Moses came to the place appointed by Us, and his Lord addressed him, He said: “O my Lord! show (Thyself) to me, that I may look upon thee.” Allah said: “By no means canst thou see Me (direct); But look upon the mount; if it abide in its place, then shalt thou see Me.” When his Lord manifested His glory on the Mount, He made it as dust. And Moses fell down in a swoon. When he recovered his senses he said: “Glory be to Thee! to Thee I turn in repentance, and I am the first to believe.” (7:143).
   “And this was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, and so did Jacob; “Oh my sons! Allah hath chosen the Faith for you; then die not except in the Faith of Islam,” (2:132).</P>
 <P>Does Allah forgive or not forgive those who worship false gods?
   Allah forgiveth not that partners should be set up with Him; but He forgiveth anything else, to whom He pleaseth; to set up partners with Allah is to devise a sin Most heinous indeed,” (4:48).  Also 4:116
   The people of the Book ask thee to cause a book to descend to them from heaven: Indeed they asked Moses for an even greater (miracle), for they said: “Show us Allah in public,” but they were dazed for their presumption, with thunder and lightning. Yet they worshipped the calf even after clear signs had come to them; even so we forgave them; and gave Moses manifest proofs of authority,” (4:153).</P>
 <P>Are Allah’s decrees changed or not?
   “Rejected were the messengers before thee: with patience and constancy they bore their rejection and their wrongs until Our aid did reach them: there is none that can alter the words (and decrees) of Allah. Already hast thou received some account of those messengers,” (6:34).
   “The word of thy Lord doth find its fulfillment in truth and in justice: None can change His words: for He is the one who heareth and knoweth all, (6:115).
   None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar: Knowest thou not that Allah Hath power over all things?” (2:106).
   When We substitute one revelation for another,- and Allah knows best what He reveals (in stages),- they say, “Thou art but a forger”: but most of them understand not,” (16:101).</P>
 <P>Was Pharaoh killed or not killed by drowning?
   “We took the Children of Israel across the sea: Pharaoh and his hosts followed them in insolence and spite. At length, when overwhelmed with the flood, he said: “I believe that there is no god except Him Whom the Children of Israel believe in: I am of those who submit (to Allah in Islam). (It was said to him): “Ah now!- But a little while before, wast thou in rebellion!- and thou didst mischief (and violence)!  This day shall We save thee in the body, that thou mayest be a sign to those who come after thee! but verily, many among mankind are heedless of Our Signs!” (10:90-92).
   Moses said, “Thou knowest well that these things have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as eye-opening evidence: and I consider thee indeed, O Pharaoh, to be one doomed to destruction!”  So he resolved to remove them from the face of the earth: but We did drown him and all who were with him,” (17:102-103).</P>
 <P>Is wine consumption good or bad?
   O ye who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, (dedication of) stones, and (divination by) arrows, are an abomination,–of Satan’s handwork: eschew such (abomination), that ye may prosper,” (5:90).
   (Here is) a Parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised: in it are rivers of water incorruptible; rivers of milk of which the taste never changes; rivers of wine, a joy to those who drink; and rivers of honey pure and clear. In it there are for them all kinds of fruits; and Grace from their Lord. (Can those in such Bliss) be compared to such as shall dwell forever in the Fire, and be given, to drink, boiling water, so that it cuts up their bowels (to pieces)?” (47:15).
   Truly the Righteous will be in Bliss: On Thrones (of Dignity) will they command a sight (of all things): Thou wilt recognize in their faces the beaming brightness of Bliss. Their thirst will be slaked with Pure Wine sealed,” (83:22-25).</P>

 <P>And theres many many many more contradictions in quran but lets continue refuting ibn taymiyyah</P>
 <P>as we see in following verse that he was primarly sent to  to the Arabs of the Pre-Islamic era. so the christians dont contradict themselves in that.</P>
 <P>My answer to the third argument:</P>
 <P> Again, the christians that claimed those things were absolutely true about what were they saying. the stuff they were saying was strictly discusses throughout the whole quran and stated within context so i dont see how it applies to this. ibn taymiyyah really has no consensus or proof of his arguments.</P>
 <P>my answer to the fourth argument: </P>
 <P>No, the statement " if christians use certain verses of quran then they should use  the quran by whole" is not necessarily true,  Sure there may be other verses that state in defense of other verse but the whole point of the christians argument is to pinpoint the contradiction in quran, not to use the quran as a whole and i would actually say the same to ibn taymiyyah to use the bible as a whole when pointing out " contradictions" in the bible as he uses arguments out of context which can easily be refuted. </P>
 <P>In fact, ibn taymiyyah has many mistakes in his books which are:</P>
 <P>The  missuse of Sources of Ibn Taymiyya’s Ideas</P>
 <P>Ibn Taymiyya’s Literal Representation of Allah’s “Descent”</P>
 <P>Ibn Taymiyya Compares Allah to the Moon</P>
 <P>Ibn Taymiyya about Tawassul and Shafa’a</P>
 <P>But i wont got to all that, ill talk about one of his mistakes : </P>
 <P>Ibn Taymiyya Compares Allah to the Moon</P>
 <P>Ibn Taymiyya Compares Allah to the Moon in his infamous `Aqida wasitiyya</P>
 <P>Ibn Taymiyya establishes a clear-cut case of tamthil or similitude for Allah and His attributes by comparing Him to the moon in his interpretation of the verse 57:4: “He is with you wherever you are”:</P>
 <P>The phrase “and He is with you” does not mean that He blends into creation… Nay the moon… one of the smallest of Allah’s creations, is both placed in the heaven (mawdu`un fi al-samaa’) and present with the traveler and the non-traveler wherever they may be. And the Exalted is above (fawq) the Throne, as a watchful guardian of His creatures and their protector Who is cognizant of them.1</P>
 <P>Ibn Taymiyya’s admirers may claim that he represents the doctrine of Ahl al-Sunna, but we all know that none of the Ahl al-Sunna ever compared Allah to the moon, or Allah’s knowledge to the moon’s rays. Exalted is Allah high above the fancies of those who give such examples for Him. Yet we find today the same type of aberration still passing for Islamic education, in books such as Ibn al-`Uthaymin’s Sharh al`aqida al-wasitiyya, which we will address in a few pages, and where the author, dissatisfied with Ibn Taymiyya’s moon, turns to comparing Allah to the sun instead.</P>
 <P>In consequence of such strange positions, Ibn Taymiyya was imprisoned by agreement of the Muslim scholars of Egypt and Syria who wished to prevent the dissemination of his ideas. His imprisonment, it should be stressed, came as a result of the consensus of the scholars of his time and not, as it is falsely claimed by his admirers, a massive conspiracy against him. Nor was he put in jail by a tyrannical ruler, nor due to the jealousy of his contemporaries, as is postulated today by some of those who claim to follow his teachings. One fears the authorities made him something of a martyr instead, and thus stimulated interest in his otherwise pedestrian observations touching on Divine attributes. We will mention his deviations concerning other topics later, insha Allah. We close this section with the recapitulation of Ibn Taymiyya’s deviations and his unmitigated condemnation by al-Haytami.</P>
 <P>Ibn Hajar al-Haytami’s Scathing Condemnation of Ibn Taymiyya</P>
 <P>Shaykh al-Islam Ahmad ibn Muhammad Abu al-`Abbas Shihab al-Din al-Haytami, known as Ibn Hajar al-Haytami (909-974/ 1504-1567) was the Shafi`i Imam of his time, a brilliant scholar of in-depth applications of Shari`a, and with Imam Ahmad al-Ramli, represents the foremost resource for legal opinion (fatwa) for the entire late Shafi`i school. He was educated at al-Azhar, but later moved to Mecca, where he authored major works in Shafi`i jurisprudence, hadith, tenets of faith, education, hadith commentary, and formal legal opinion. His most famous works include Tuhfat al-muhtaj bi sharh al-minhaj (The gift of him in need: an explanation of “The Road”), a commentary on Nawawi’s Minhaj al-Talibin (The seeker’s road) whose ten volumes represent a high point in Shafi`i scholarship; the four-volume al-Fatawa al-kubra al-fiqhiyya (The major collection of legal opinions); and al-Zawajir `an iqtiraf al-kaba’ir (Deterrents from committing enormities) which with its detailed presentation of Qur’an and hadith evidence and masterful legal inferences, remains unique among Muslim works dealing with godfearingness (taqwa) and is even recognized by Hanafi scholars like Ibn `Abidin as a source of authoritative legal texts (nusus) valid in their own school.2</P>
 <P>He writes in his Fatawa hadithiyya:</P>
 <P>Ibn Taymiyya is a slave which Allah has forsaken and misguided and blinded and deafened and debased. That is the declaration of the imams who have exposed the corruption of his positions and the mendacity of his sayings. Whoever wishes to pursue this must read the words of the mujtahid imam Abu al-Hasan (Taqi al-Din) al-Subki, of his son Taj al-Din Subki, of the Imam al-`Izz ibn Jama`a and others of the Shafi`i, Maliki, and Hanafi shaykhs…In short, his words are not given any importance whatsoever; rather they are thrown aside into every wasteland and rocky ground, and it must be considered that he is a misguided and misguiding innovator (mubtadi` dall mudill) and an ignorant who brought evil (jahilun ghalun) whom Allah treated with His justice, and may He protect us from the likes of his path, doctrine, and actions, Amin…Know that he has differed from people on questions about which Taj al-Din al-Subki and others warned us. Among the things Ibn Taymiyya said which violate the scholarly consensus are:</P>
 <P>1) that he who violates the consensus commits neither disbelief (kufr) nor transgression (fisq)</P>
 <P>2)that our Lord is subject to created events (mahallun li al-hawadith) — glorified, exalted, and sanctified is He far above what the wrong-doers and rejecters ascribe to Him!</P>
 <P>3)that He is complex or made of parts (murakkab), His Essence standing in need similarly to the way the whole stands in need of the parts (taftaqiru dhatuhu iftiqara al-kulli li al-juz’), elevated is He and sanctified above that!</P>
 <P>4)that the Qur’an is created in Allah’s Essence (muhdath fi dhatillah),3elevated is He above that!</P>
 <P>5)that the world (al-`alam) is of a pre-eternal nature (qadim bi al-naw`) and that it existed with Allah from pre-eternity (wa lam yazal ma` Allah) as an everlasting created object (makhluqan da’iman), thus making it necessarily existent in His Essence (fa ja`alahu mujaban bi al-dhat) and not acting deliberately (la fa`ilan bi al-ikhtyar), elevated is He above that!4</P>
 <P>6)his sayings about Allah’s “corporeality,” “direction,” “displacement,” (al-jismiyya wa al-jiha wa al-intiqal), and that He fits the size of the Throne, being neither bigger nor smaller, exalted is He from such a hideous invention and wide-open disbelief (kufr), and may He forsake all his followers, and may all his beliefs be scattered and lost!</P>
 <P>And many more mistakes that ibn taymiyyah wrote about in his books. but i wont get to that as there are to  many mistakes in his books which im not suprised about. but lets continue refuting his book.</P>
 <P>Two: Proving that Prophet Muhammad (peace be
    upon him) was sent to All Mankind:</P>
 <P>To those who claim that Muhammad (peace be upon him)
    was sent for the pagan Arabs only, we say, “It is well
    known that Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent to
    the Jews, the Christians as well as to the pagan Arabs.
    This has been expressed recurrently through transmitted
    traditions about the Prophet (peace be upon him), which
    are clearer, more obvious and greater than those related
    to Musa (Moses), ‘Isa (Jesus) and all other Prophets
    (peace be upon them all). It is also asserted in the Qur’an
    and the Prophetic hadiths and the traditions of the
    Rightly-guided Caliphs who came after the Prophet
    (peace be upon him). Furthermore, we stress that he has
    been sent to all the children of Adam (i.e., all human
    beings): the Arabs, the Non-Arabs, the Romans, the
    Persians, Turks, Indians, Barbarians, Abyssinians and to
    all other nations and races. Indeed, he was sent to both:
    mankind and Jinn. This conclusion is reached by plain,
    obvious continuous facts and news transmitted
    throughout the centuries and throughout history upon
    which all the Prophet's Companions have agreed and
    transmitted from him. This is despite their large number
    and the fact that they were scattered throughout the
    world. Their number was estimated to be tens of thousands, while their exact number is known by none but
    Allah</P>
 <P>These transmissions were reported by the followers of the
    Companions (i.e., the first generation after the
    Companions) whose number was several times that of
    the Companions. Then, these traditions were transmitted
    throughout the centuries and generations until this time of
    ours in which many Muslims are spread all over this vast
    world, extending and dwelling from its east to its west
    and from its north to its south. This is a fact, which the
    Prophet (peace be upon him) foretold in his hadith,
    recorded by Imam Muslim: Thawban (may Allah be
    pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah
    (peace be upon him) said, “Allah drew the ends of the
    world near one another for my sake. And I have seen its
    eastern and western ends. And the dominion of my nation
    shall reach those ends which have been drawn near me.”1</P>
 <P>It is exactly as he said; the reign of his nation has
    reached the two ultimate edges of the planet, eastward
    and westward and his message has spread throughout
    the earth.
    </P>
 <P>It is or intention to prove that Muhammad (peace be upon
    him) called the people of the scripture, i.e., the Jews and
    the Christians, to believe in him, in his message and in
    that with which he was sent. He aiso called those who
    had never received any message from Allah before him,
    like the Arabs and other nations. He, i.e., Muhammad
    (peace be upon him), said that anyone who refuses to
    believe in him as a Messenger from Allah, in the Qur’an</P>
 <P>and in his message as a whole, is nothing but a
    disbeliever and that such people will be thrown into
    Hellfire, and this is indeed the worst destination. He also
    said that he received the Command of Allah that such
    disbelievers should be fought and struggled against. The
    Prophet (peace be upon him) carried out the task of
    informing them by himself as well as through his
    deputies.
    </P>
 <P>So this continuing to page 55 of the pdf but i  wont say his refutations as you guys are free to look it up, ill just debunk it.</P>
 <P>Ibn taymiyyah first claims that  Allah welcomes jews and christians and calls to them while this is not true. as we see in  5:51 to 5:53:</P>
 <P>The Prohibition of Taking the Jews, Christians and Enemies of Islamas Friends
    </P>
 <P>Allah forbids His believing servants from having Jews and Christians as friends, because they are the enemies of Islam and its people, may Allah curse them. Allah then states that they are friends of each other and He gives a warning threat to those who do this,</P>
 <P>(And if any among you befriends them, then surely he is one of them.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Umar ordered Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari to send him on one sheet of balance the count of what he took in and what he spent. Abu Musa then had a Christian scribe, and he was able to comply with `Umar's demand. `Umar liked what he saw and exclaimed, "This scribe is proficient. Would you read in the Masjid a letter that came to us from Ash-Sham" Abu Musa said, `He cannot." `Umar said, "Is he not pure" Abu Musa said, "No, but he is Christian." Abu Musa said, "So `Umar admonished me and poked my thigh (with his finger), saying, `Drive him out (from Al-Madinah).' He then recited,</P>
 <P>in this passage we see that allah doesnt calll christians or jews to embrace islam. he openly curses the jews and christians and even condems for people to have jews or christians as friends or even be near them.</P>
 <p>but lets prove allahs cruelty against jews and christians.</p>
 <p>ALLAH TORTURES JEWS AND CHRISTIANS IN PLACE OF MUSLIMS</p>
 <p>The aim of this post is to gather together in one place the different versions of a report attributed to Muhammad where he claims that his deity will torture Jews and Christians in hell for the sins committed by Muslims. The purpose for me doing so is to show just how sadistic, evil, and wicked Muhammad’s Allah truly is.

   I begin with the following narrative:
   
   Superiority of the believers in the Oneness of Allah and the punishment of the Jews and Christians
   
   8) Narrated Abu Musa: Allah’s Messenger said: On the Day of Resurrection, my Ummah (nation) will be gathered into three groups. One sort will enter Paradise without rendering an account (of their deeds). Another sort will be reckoned an easy account and admitted into Paradise. Yet another sort will come bearing on their backs heaps of sins like great mountains. Allah will ask the angels though He knows best about them: Who are these people? They will reply: They are humble slaves of yours. He will say: UNLOAD the sins from them AND PUT THE SAME OVER the Jews and Christians: then let the humble slaves get into Paradise by virtue of My Mercy.
   
   (This Hadith IS SOUND and mentioned in Mustadrak of Hakim). (110 Hadith Qudsi (Sacred Hadith), translated by Syed Masood-ul-Hasan, revision and commentaries by Ibrahim m. Kunna [Darussalam Publishers and Distributors], pp. 19-20 https://islamicstudies.info/hadith/110-Ahadith-Qudsi.pdf – see also https://ahadith.co.uk/110ahadithqudsi.php; capital and underline emphasis mine)
   
   There’s more:
   
   432. Abu Musa Al-Ash’ari reported: Messenger of Allah said, “On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will deliver to every Muslim, a Jew or a Christian and say: ‘This is YOUR RANSOM from Hell-fire.”‘
   
   Another narration is: Messenger of Allah said, “There would come people amongst the Muslims on the Day of Resurrection with sins as heavy as a mountain, and Allah would forgive them”.
   
   [Muslim]. (Al-Imam Abu Zakariya Yahya bin Sharaf An-Nawawi Ad-Dimashqi, Riyad as-Salihin (The Meadows of the Righteous), The Book of Miscellany, 51. Chapter: On Hope https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin:432; bold and capital emphasis mine)</p>
 <p>(20) CHAPTER. Disbelievers are sent to Hell as SACRIFICE to the Muslims

   1937. Abu Musa narrated that the Messenger of Allah said: “When it is the Day of Resurrection, Allah will deliver every Muslim a Jew or Christian and say: ‘THAT IS YOUR SACRIFICE FROM HELL-FIRE.’” (The Translation of the Meanings of Summarized Sahih Muslim (Arabic–English), Compiled by Al-Hafiz Zakiuddin Abdul-Azim Al-Mundhiri [Darussalam Publishers & Distributors, First Edition: February 2000], Volume 2, 62– The Book Of Repentance And Allah’s Great Mercy, pp. 1033-1034)
   
   And here is a different translation of the above hadith, along with a couple of others from Sahih Muslim:</p>
 <p>Chapter 8: THROWING OF NON-BELIEVERS IN HELL-FIRE FOR BELIEVERS AS DIVINE GRACE AND MERCY</p>
 <p>Abu Musa’ reported that Allah’s Messenger said: When it will be the Day of Resurrection Allah would deliver to every Muslim a Jew or a Christian and say: That is your RESCUE from Hell-Fire. (Sahih Muslim, Book 037, Number 6665 https://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=037&translator=2&start=0&number=6665)

   Abu Burda reported on the authority of his father that Allah’s Apostle said: No Muslim would die but Allah would admit IN HIS STEAD a Jew or a Christian in Hell-Fire. ‘Umar b. Abd al-‘Aziz took an oath: By One besides Whom there is no god but He, thrice that his father had narrated that to him from Allah’s Messenger. (Sahih Muslim, Book 037, Number 6666)
   
   Abu Burda reported Allah’s Messenger as saying: There would come people amongst the Muslims on the Day of Resurrection with AS HEAVY SINS AS A MOUNTAIN, and Allah would FORGIVE THEM and He would PLACE IN THEIR STEAD the Jews and the Christians. (As far as I think), Abu Raub said: I do not know as to who is in doubt. Abu Burda said: I narrated it to ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, whereupon he said: Was it your father who narrated it to you from Allah’s Apostle? I said: Yes. (Sahih Muslim, Book 037, Number 6668)
   
   This next one is even more heinous and sadistic since it has Allah laughing over the fact that Jews and Christians will be tortured in hell in the place of Muhammadans:</p>
 <p>In a slightly more detailed version, Abu Musa leads us to an explanation of the reason for God’s laughter:</p>
 <p>The Prophet said: “On the Day of Resurrection our Lord, to Him belong glory and greatness, shall be revealed to us, laughing (yataglla dahikan). And He will say: ‘Rejoice, you Muslims! For I have REPLACED each one of you destined to go to Hell with a Jew or a Christian’.”17 (Livnat Holtzman, “‘Does God Really Laugh?” – Appropriate and Inappropriate Descriptions of God in Islamic Traditionalist Theology,’” Laughter in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Times (Fundamentals of Medieval and Early Modern Culture), ed. Albrecht Classen [De Gruyter, Berlin/New York; 1st edition, 2010], Chapter 2, p. 172; bold and capital emphasis mine)

   17 Al‐Agurri, Kitab al‐sariah, 295, hadith no. 641; Al‐Agurri, Kitab al‐tasdiq, 76. (Ibid.)
   
   The foregoing Islamic scholar quotes a lengthier version of the aforementioned hadith elsewhere:
   
   The Messenger of God said: When the Day of Resurrection comes God will bring all the nations together in the same plateau. And when He sees fit to separate between His creatures, He will present to each nation [the idol] that they used to worship. The people will follow their idols until they will be pushed into the fire. Then our Lord the Blessed and Exalted will come to us as we stand in a high place, and say: ‘Who are you?’ and we will say: ‘We are the Muslims.’ He will say: ‘What are you waiting for you? They (i.e. the Muslims) will say: ‘We are waiting for our Lord the Blessed and Exalted.’ He will say: ‘How will you recognize Him when you have never seen Him?’ And they will say: ‘He has no equal.’ Then, He will be revealed to them laughing, and say: ‘Rejoice, oh you Muslims! For I have already replaced each one of you destined to go to Hell with a Jew or a Christian.’59 (Holtzman, Anthropomorphism in Islam: The Challenge of Traditionalism (700-1350) [Edinburgh University Press LTD, 2019], 1. The Narrator and the Narrative: A Literary Analysis of Ahadith al-Sifat, pp. 33-34; bold emphasis mine)</p>
 <p>She cites other versions of this report:

   When the Day of Resurrection arrives, [the idols] that each nation used to worship in this world will be presented before them. Each nation will approach [the idol] that they used to worship in this world, and only the monotheists (ahl al-tawhid) will remain. Someone will then say to them: ‘What are you waiting for, when everyone else has already gone?’65 And they we will answer: ‘We have a lord whom we used to worship in the material world, but we have never seen him.’ They will be asked: ‘Will you know him when you see him?’ They will say: ‘Yes.’ They will be asked: ‘So, how will you recognize him, when you have never seen him?’ They will answer: ‘Because there is nothing similar to him.’ Suddenly, the curtain will be drawn in front of them, and they will see God, the mighty and powerful. Immediately they will prostrate themselves on the ground – all, but a group of people who will want to prostrate themselves but will be unable to do so, because their backs will be stuck and erect like cattle’s horns. This [scene] will be exactly as described in the Quranic verse: ‘On the day when the dread event unfolds and they are told to prostrate themselves, they will be unable.66 So God will say to them: ‘Raise your heads up, because for each and every one of you I marked A SUBSTITUTE who is either a Jew or a Christian, to be sent INSTEAD OF YOU to Hell.’67 (Ibid., p. 36; bold and capital emphasis mine)</p>
 <p>According to his avowal, Sa’id ibn Abi Burda accompanied his father in the delegation to the caliph al-Walid. As Ahmad ibn Hanbal remarked, Sa’id never denied that ‘Umar asked his father to swear on the authenticity of the hadith that he recounted to him. Following the material in Ahmad ibn Habnbal’s Musnad and Muslim’s Sahih, Ibn ‘Asakir added that Sa’id never denied nor affirmed this incident.98 According to Sa’id, after completing his business with ‘Umar, Abu Burda awakened Sa’id in the middle of the night and led him through the streets of Damascus. They arrived at ‘Umar’s house, which was situated between the vegetable market and the cheese market, and knocked on the gate of the house. The gatekeeper informed Abu Burda that ‘Umar had already retired to bed, but Abu Burda insisted on informing ‘Umar that he was waiting for him at the gate. Soon after, permission was granted for Abu Burda and his son to enter the house. ‘Is something wrong, Abu Burda?’ – asked ‘Umar whose sleep was interrupted. ‘Everything is fine’ – answered Abu Burda. ‘What is that you want?’  – asked ‘Umar. Abu Burda explained: ‘I finished my business, but I remembered a hadith that my father had told me. And here it is: The Messenger of God said: When the people will be gathered for Judgment Day, a Jew or a Christian will be brought, and [a voice] will say:  Oh Believer! This is the SACRIFICE that will REDEEM YOU from Hell!’99 ‘Umar asked: ‘Did you hear it from your father?’ Abu Burda confirmed this… (Ibid., pp. 43-44; capital emphasis mine)</p>
 <P>I [Qudama ibn Hamata al-Dabbi] was sitting at ‘Umar ‘Abd al-‘Aziz’s when suddenly Abu Burda, the son of Abu Musa came in, and told ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz that he once heard his father tell the following hadith on the authority of the Prophet, who said, ‘In the Day of Resurrection, the Jew and the Christian will be brought and a voice will say: “Oh Muslim, this is THE SACRIFICE that will REDEEM YOU from Hell”.’ ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz said to Abu Burda: ‘Allah, there is no god but Him! Did you hear your father tell this hadith on the authority of the Messenger of God?’ [Abu Burda] said: ‘Allah, there is no god but Him! My father indeed told me this hadith, and he in his turn heard it from the Messenger of God.’ [Qudama said]: I then saw ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz prostrate himself in adoration three times.107 (Ibid., p. 45; capital emphasis mine)  </P>
 <P>And many more, but lets get on with refuting him.</P>
 <P>Second ibn taymiyyah claims that  Negus Believed in the Prophet (peace be upon
    him) but this is not true:</P>
 <P>according to Islamic tradition, Negus was a Christian king of Ethiopia who provided refuge to a group of early Muslims who fled persecution in Mecca. This is mentioned in various Islamic sources, including the books "Siyar A‘lam al-Nubala'" by Al-Dhahabi and "Al-Bidaya wa Al-Nihaya" by Ibn Kathir. These sources describe Negus as a just and fair ruler who welcomed the Muslims and recognized the similarities between Islam and Christianity.  But theres no evidence of him actually being muslim, as historical witnesses say otherwise. </P>
 <P>Christanisation of a Nation</P>
 <P>The advent of Christianity within Ethiopia in the 3rd and 4th century is a fact established within secular and religious histories. The narrative is a derivate from Ethiopic and non-Ethiopic sources (Kaplan 1982:28). A revisionist attempt at the account and the deductions formerly made regarding the Christianisation of Ethiopia in the conversion of Ezana is merited. Kaplan derived an aggregated account in the perspective of Theodoret,  Ruﬁnus and Ethiopic sources in sync with the survey and discussion of sources done by Petrides (1971:81–99). There are notable elements within the narrative that tie in with the reality of maritime travel. Frumentius and Aedesius were Syrian captives taken from a plundered ship; they found themselves in the court of the king (Kaplan 1982:28). This inceptionally highlights the inﬂuence of Syrian-Eastern Christianity within the Ethiopian Christian cultural matrix, thereby implying an elongated relationship, one that was analogous to time. Whilst there can be a discussion on 1st century CE apostolic Christianity engaging Ethiopia (Rukuni & Oliver 2020), the reference to Syrian-Eastern Christians introducing their aspect of Christianity to Ethiopia at this respective moment is a reference to the 3rd and 4th century CE.</P>
 <P>The narrative regarding Frumentius and Aedesius reads more as a legend, yet there are certain entrenched undertones that enhance the deductions regarding the religious-political complex of Ethiopia. Frumentius and Aedesius are said to have been enrolled into the service of the King; therefore, even in their unfortunate circumstances, they were still perceived with high esteem it seems (Theodoret Hist.Eccles 1.22, ed. Schaff 1885b:127; Ruﬁnus, Historia Ecclesiastica 10.9–10; Amidon 1997:18–20). This implies that they were not taken as low-ranking slaves but rather as nobles; this resonates with the purposed Thomine contact with Gundaphar (Acts Thom 2:22–27; ed. James 1924:9–11), as a skilled craftsman eligible for royal service. Whilst Aedesius was taken in as a cupbearer, Frumentius was honoured with the service of treasurer and secretary. Whilst it is essential to substantiate the Ethiopian enslaving practice within the aforementioned respect, there are implied allusive features in the legend. These possibly derive from the inﬂuence of Judaic and apostolic Christian tradition on Ethiopia (Piovanelli 2014:690). Firstly, the reference to Aedesius as a cupbearer reads more as the appointment of biblical Nehemiah an important exilic leader of the Jews in the time of the Persian dominance of the BCE era (Neh 2–13). Nehemiah’s inﬂuence with the Persian monarch Cyrus ultimately saw the return of the Jews to the promised land. Nehemiah held the position of cupbearer with the Persian monarch yet; he incited a conversation that was deﬁnitive of the orient from which he originated, as there was imperial policy that was crafted in favour of his ethnicity (Neh 2–13). In an equally signiﬁcant parallel, the appointment of Frumentius as treasurer and secretary of the monarch resonates with the Lukan-Acts account of the Ethiopian Eunuch who met Phillip (Ac 8:26–38). Therefore, the legend has some Judaic–Christian connotations  which perhaps could be an index for a more substantial reality concerning the advent of Christianity in Ethiopia</P>
 <P>Upon the death of the monarch Frumentius and Aedesius governed at the instruction of the queen regent pending the maturity of Negus Ezana (Jones & Monroe 1935:26–27). This claim appears relatively unusual; however, it sheds light on the symbiotic relationship between the Ethiopian aristocracy and the clerical establishment, which is also an implication of the monarchical inﬂuence in Ethiopian Christianity (Binns 2017:43). Frumentius is said to have sought out and empowered the exotic Christian mercantile community (Kaplan 1982:28). This would be possible in the face of the cosmopolitan nature of the port of Adulis (Bowersock 2013:30; Periplus 4; Casson 1989:51, 52). This, however, also implies that there was need for much foreign contact in establishing the native Christianity, a fact that can be rebutted in the perspective of the apostolic connections (Ac 8:26–38; Rukuni & Oliver 2020). Aggregately, however, the narrative entrenches the signiﬁcance of the maritime links of Aksumite-Ethiopia in the Christianisation of its country. A point already noted corresponded to these events when Ezana becomes of age Aedesius left for Tyre and Frumentius Alexandria from where he received the appointment of ﬁrst Bishop of Ethiopia at the hands of Athanasius (Jones & Monroe 1935:26–27). This element of the narrative is corroborated through the imperial inter-exchange of letters between Constantius and Ezana (Jamme 1966:34). This brings up the question regarding the conversion of Ezana and its dating</P>
 <P>This is the whole refutation till page 55 as the other text just werent arguments and were useless for me to debunk ( also it doenst have any proof of it  or any consensus as many witnesses suggest otherwise)</P>
 <P>From  page 56 to 61 he tries to prove that prohet muhammad was sent to all mankind, and i agree  that the quran says he was sent to all mankind but the point is that in the quran it also says the primarly reason that muhammad was sent was for pre-islamic arabs thus its a contradiction in the quran ( or even if it may not be a contradiction the fact remains his primary reason was that he was sent down for pre-islamic arab). the verses that say muhammad was sent down tos</P>
 <P>After that ibn taymiyyah foccuses on proving the prophethood of muhammad using quran, lets say part of ibn taymiyyahs argument and then lets debunk the prophethood of muhammad. ibn taymiyyahs arguments:</P>
 <P>Allah, the Almighty mentions in the verses of the Qur’an,
    that the people of the Book used to invoke Allah for the
    coming of Muhammad (peace be upon him) in order to
    gain victory over the pagan Arabs, before his mission.
    They used to fight against the Arabs and the Arabs used
    to defeat them, whereupon they would say, “Verily, Allah
    will send an illiterate Prophet from amongst the offspring
    of Isma'TI (Ishmael, peace be upon him) whom we will
    follow. Under his leadership we will defeat and destroy
    you with utter destruction.” Then, they would proceed to
    tell the features and the description of the promised
    Prophet. This is well-known from the continuous
    narrations descending from one century to the next
    illustrating that meaning. Allah, the Exalted, says: which means, “And when there came to them (the Jews),
    a Book (this Qur’an) from Allah confirming what is with
    them (the Tawrah (Torah) and the InjTI (Gospel)), although
    aforetime they had invoked Allah (for the coming of
    Muhammad peace be upon him) in order to gain victory
    over those who disbelieved, then when there came to
    them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it.
    So let the Curse of Allah be on the disbelievers.” (AlBaqarah, 2: 89)</P>
 <P>The signs and miracles, which prove the prophethood of
    the Prophet (peace be upon him) exceeded one</P>
 <P>thousand. Examples of these miracles are: the splitting of
    the moon, the miraculous Qur’an, information about the
    people of the Scripture before him, the glad tidings
    conveyed by the Prophets concerning him, the story of
    the elephant which Allah made as a sign before his birth,
    and the adornment of the sky and making it throw
    shooting stars upon the devils. In addition, one of the
    most significant of his miracles was providing information
    concerning unKnown matters about which none had
    knowledge, except through receiving revelation from
    Allah, the Exalted and Ever-Majestic. Without being
    taught by any human, he related what had happened in
    the past concerning the tales of Nuh (Noah), Hud,
    Shu'aib, Salih and many others (peace be upon them all).
    His people knew very well that he was neither taught by
    the people of the Book nor by anyone else. In fact, he
    was illiterate.</P>
 <P>We intend here to clarify that the prophet (peace be upon
    him) used to tell people about the events of the past with
    detailed information, which nobody could know but a
    Prophet or a person informed by a Prophet. His people
    knew very well that no human being told him about such
    information and that very matter represented an argument
    against them. In spite of their strong enmity toward him
    and their keen desire to seek even the tiniest defect so
    that they may take it against him, they were unable to find
    or raise an acceptable argument against him. It was easy
    for his people to claim that the Prophet (peace be upon
    him) was taught by some people, but since his people
    could not accuse him of that, no one else has the right to
    accuse him of something which his own people were
    unable to do. The Exalted says,</P>
 <P>which means, “This is of the news of the unseen which
    We reveal unto you (O Muhammad), neither you nor your
    people knew them before this. So be patient. Surely, the
    (good) end is for the Muttaqun (pious). (Hud, 11: 49)
    Here it is stated that neither Muhammad nor his people
    had knowledge of these tales before the revelation of the
    Qur'an, and his people testified to this truth. So, whoever
    claims that Muhammad (peace be upon him) was taught
    by any one is telling a manifest lie</P>
 <P>So this is a part of his arguments. he continues it till page 65 but lets refute his claims. My response to him:</P>
 <P>Surely i agree that there is some small proof of muhammads prophethood ( using the quran ) but also in the quran many many many things are mentioned that rejects any idea of his prophethood and actually tells us that he is not a prophet. lets go through them.</P>
 <P>Muhammad was a Bad Example for all Mankind
   History tells us that, at first, Muhammad did not use force to induce the Jews, Christians and pagans to accept Islam. Later, however, when people and circumstances turned against him and when he began to gather an army to himself, he began telling his followers that the latest "revelations from Allah" were saying things like:
   
   "Prophet, make war on the unbelievers and the hypocrites and deal rigorously with them. Hell shall be their home." (9:73) </P>
 <P>Thus began Muhammad’s career of warring in the name of Allah. Those defeated by Muhammad were offered protection if they would submit to the dictates of Islam. Those that refused to become Muslims had the "choice" either to pay tribute or to be put to death. This is the apparent "peace and tolerance" Muhammad offered to non-Muslims in his treaty with the people of Khaibar and to others. Non-Muslims were the Dhimmis (the people of obligation) and, as such, were to be </P>
 <P>
   "utterly subdued" (9:29).
   
   About twenty years ago, a Muslim neighbor lent me his book on the life of Muhammad, hoping to attract me to Islam. Amid the many positive things recorded about Muhammad, one phrase that sticks with me to this day is that the Muslim author wrote that Muhammad could be both "</P>
   <p> "compassionate and cruel." One of the better-known examples of Muhammad’s "cruel side" is recorded in several Hadiths, as well as in other writings such as the History of Tabari, Sirat Rasul Allah, and the Kitab Al Tabaqat Al Kabir ...</p>
   <p>"A group of eight men from the tribe of 'Ukil came to the Prophet and then they found the climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So, they said, ‘O Allah's Apostle! Provide us with some milk.’ Allah's Apostle said, ‘I recommend that you should join the herd of camels.’ So they went and drank the urine and the milk of the camels (as a medicine) till they became healthy and fat. Then they killed the shepherd and drove away the camels, and they became unbelievers after they were Muslims. When the Prophet was informed by a shouter for help, he sent some men in their pursuit, and before the sun rose high, they were brought, and he had their hands and feet cut off. Then he ordered for nails which were heated and passed over their eyes, and they were left in the Harra (i.e. rocky land in Medina). They asked for water, and nobody provided them with water till they died." (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 52, Number 261: Narrated by Anas bin Malik.)</p>
   <p>The oldest still-available biography of Muhammad is called the "Sirat Rasul Allah" ("Life of the Prophet of Allah"). This book was written by Ibn Ishaq a century before any of the major works of the Hadith. "Sirat Rasulallah" is considered the most authentic biography of Muhammad. On page 515, we read of an event that took place about three years before Muhammad's death. This specific narrative tells of Muhammad’s conquest of Khaibar, a large Jewish settlement with some of the best date palms in the region. The Jews of Khaibar were prosperous merchants, craftsmen, and farmers. Kinana al-Rabi, who was said to have had the custody of a certain hidden treasure, was brought to Muhammad who asked him about it. Kinana denied that he knew where it was. A Jew came to the apostle and said that he had seen Kinana going round a certain ruin every morning early. When the apostle said to Kinana:
   </p>
   <p>"Do you know that if we find you have it I shall kill you?" He said "Yes."
   </p>
   <p>Muhammad gave orders that the ruin be excavated and some of the treasure was found. When he asked Kinana about the rest of the treasure he refused to produce it, so the apostle gave orders to al-Zubayr Al-Awwam:</p>
   <p>"Torture him until you extract what he has."

      So he kindled a fire with flint and steel on his chest until he was nearly dead. Then Muhammad delivered him to Muhammad b. Maslama and he struck off his head. Were Muhammad’s actions in keeping with a religion that is for peace? And this is only one such example among many.
      Friends, do not take my word on this. </p>
   <p>
      Do your own research. Take a look at the above-mentioned biography (English translation: "The Life of Muhammad" by A. Guillaume; Oxford Univ. Press) or "23 Years: A Study of the Prophetic Career of Mohammad" (by Ali Dashti; Mazda), or read some of the Hadiths. You will even read of instances in which Muhammad had innocent people put to death (such as Abu Afak, a 120-year-old man and Asma bint Marwan the mother of five children, a slave woman mother of two children, and the one-eye shepherd, all murdered while they slept. Their only crime was that they somehow offended "the prophet.")</p>
   <p>I am keenly aware that such information is both painful and offensive for my dear Muslim friends. Yet truth is truth. Jesus didn’t beat around the bush when He said, "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles? Even so every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. ... False prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders, so as to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 

      See, I have told you before hand. ... Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind, both will fall into a ditch." (Injil, Matthew 7:15-17; 24:23,24; 15:14)</p>
   <p>As has been related, this Mohammed wrote many ridiculous books, to each one of which he set a title. For example, there is the book On Woman, [109] in which he plainly makes legal provision for taking four wives and, if it be possible, a thousand concubines—as many as one can maintain, besides the four wives. He also made it legal to put away whichever wife one might wish, and, should one so wish, to take to oneself another in the same way. Mohammed had a friend named Zeid. This man had a beautiful wife with whom Mohammed fell in love. Once, when they were sitting together, Mohammed said: ‘Oh, by the way, God has commanded me to take your wife.’ The other answered: ‘You are an apostle. Do as God has told you and take my wife.’ Rather—to tell the story over from the beginning—he said to him: ‘God has given me the command that you put away your wife.’ And he put her away. Then several days later: ‘Now,’ he said, ‘God has commanded me to take her.’ Then, after he had taken her and committed adultery with her, he made this law: ‘Let him who will put away his wife. And if, after having put her away, he should return to her, let another marry her. For it is not lawful to take her unless she have been married by another. Furthermore, if a brother puts away his wife, let his brother marry her, should he so wish.’ [110] In the same book he gives such precepts as this: ‘Work the land which God hath given thee and beautify it. And do this, and do it in such a manner” [111]—not to repeat all the obscene things that he did.
      -St John Damascene</p>
   <p></p>
   <p></p>
   <p></p>
   <p></p>
 <P> In the night’s stillness, far from the crowd and alone with the thoughts of his heart, a man prays confessing the truth he knows within his soul:</P>
 <P>  "Oh God, I acknowledge and confess before You, all my sins, please forgive them, as no one can forgive sins except You.  Forgive my mistakes, those done intentionally, or out of my ignorance, with or without seriousness.  Oh God, forgive my sins and my ignorance, forgive my sins of the past and of the future, which I did openly or secretly.  Forgive the wrong I have done, jokingly or seriously. I seek Your protection from all the evil I have done.  Wash away my sins, and cleanse my heart, from all the sins as a white garment is cleansed from the filth, and let there be long distance between me and my sins, as You made the East and West far from each other."

 </P>
 <P>That prayer expressed a heart that understood the depth of sin in its soul. It acknowledges a nature within that is bent towards sin. And it reflects the desire to cleanse that depth of sin.  We hear in that prayer a man’s struggle with sin.  He asks forgiveness for his past and future sins, because he knows that as a normal man, he is going to sin.  It is inevitable. He asks for forgiveness for things he has done intentionally, and unintentionally.  He asks forgiveness for mistakes and sins, those done intentionally or unintentionally.  He knows that the sins he committed are "evil", and confesses that to God.  He does not make light of his sins.  The sins he committed are "filth" in God’s eyes.

 </P>
 <P>WAS MUHAMMAD A SINNER?</P>
 <P>That prayer was prayed by Muhammad. It is a synthesis of his personal prayers found in Sahih Bukhari Volume 8: #s 335, 379, 407, and 408, [1]. Muhammad knew clearly he was a sinner; thus he makes his confession public. Over and over again he stated he was a sinner. The Quran he spoke identifies him as a sinner. Yet many Muslims today say that Muhammad was not a sinner.</P>
 <P>THE ISLAMIC DOCTRINE OF "PROTECTION FROM SIN"</P>
 <P>Many Muslims believe that Allah gives a special protection to his prophets from being "sinners". In his book, "Muhammad and the Religion of Islam", [2], John Gilchrist does an excellent job in addressing and summarizing this invented Islamic doctrine. It is sometimes called the "isma" doctrine. This book can be found on the web at:  http://answering-islam.org/Gilchrist/Vol1/</P>
 <P>I will quote several paragraphs from the book. From page 273:</P>
 <P>"Throughout the Muslim world today it is generally believed that all of the prophets enjoyed an "isma", a protection against sin, and that they were accordingly sinless. It is one of the anomalies of Islam that this doctrine has been established and maintained against the plain teaching of the Quran and Hadith to the contrary.

    In the early centuries of Islam, however, a doctrine founded on popular sentiment and theological presuppositions arose and developed away from the teaching of the Quran and Hadith. It was first formulated in the creed known as the Fiqh Akbar II and it is there stated:</P>
 <P>  "All the Prophets are exempt from sins, both light and grave, from unbelief and sordid deeds. Yet stumbling and mistakes may happen on their part. Wensinck, "The Muslim Creed, p. 192."</P>
 <P>It was not possible to defy the written sources of Islam entirely, however, and so the records of the sins of the prophets in the Quran and Hadith became watered down into "mistakes". Similar euphemisms, such as "acts of forgetfulness", are constantly used by Muslim writers today to account for these misdemeanors which the Scripture and traditions of Islam record.</P>
 <P>There are basically two reasons for the rise of this doctrine in Islam. Firstly, the early Muslims soon discovered that the Bible taught plainly that Jesus was the only sinless man that ever lived and, confronted with this evidence, deemed it necessary to invent the fiction that all the prophets — especially Muhammad — were sinless as well. A superiority of Jesus over Muhammad could not be tolerated and, just as miracles were attributed to the figurehead of Islam to give him a status at least equal to that of Jesus, so he was also held to be sinless for the same purpose. Secondly, the doctrine of revelation in Islam holds that the scriptures were dictated directly to the prophets by the intermediary angel (Gabriel) and it was therefore believed that the prophets must have possessed an impeccable character for, if they could not keep themselves from error in their personal lives, how could they be trusted to communicate God’s revelation without error? This latter presupposition led perforce to the conclusion that the prophets must have been sinless."</P>
 <P>END OF GILCHRIST QUOTE</P>
 <P>In sum, real Islamic writings teach that Muhammad was a sinner.  However, later Muslims, ashamed that Muhammad was inferior to Jesus in this regard, made up a doctrine to place Muhammad on equal terms with Christ.  This doctrine contradicts what Muhammad taught.  And, it should be added, that Muslims believe that God has kept the Quran pure from human corruption through all these centuries, while it was in the hands of sinful humans, then why could he not trust the transmission through sinful human men as well?</P>
 <P>THE QURANIC EVIDENCE THAT MUHAMMAD WAS A SINNER</P>
 <P>The Quran identifies Muhammad as a sinner: 40:55, 48:2, and 47:19:</P>
 <P>40:55   Therefore have patience; God’s promise is surely true. Implore forgiveness for your sins, and celebrate the praise of your Lord evening and morning.
</P>
 <P>  48:2     ... so that God may forgive you your past and future sins, and perfect His goodness to you; ...</P>
 <P>Below is the Quran 47:19 in five English translations, (NOTE: Muhammad is asking for forgiveness for both himself and his followers).</P>
 <P>"Know that there is no deity but God. Implore Him to forgive your sins and to forgive the true believers, men and women. God knows your busy haunts and resting places." Dawood [3]</P>
 <P>     "So know (O Muhammad) that there is no God save Allah, and ask forgiveness for thy sin and for believing men and believing women. Allah knoweth (both) your place of turmoil and your place of rest." Pickthall [4]</P>
 <P> "Know thou therefore that there is no god but God, and ask forgiveness for thy sin, and for the believers, men and women. God knows your going to and fro, and your lodging." Arberry [5]</P>
 <P> "Know, then, that there is no god but God; and ask pardon for thy sin, and for believers, both men and women. God knows your busy movements and your final resting places." Rodwell [6]</P>
 <P>  "Know therefore that there is no god but Allah and ask forgiveness for the fault and for the men and women who believe: for Allah knows how ye move about and how ye dwell in your homes." Ali [7]</P>
 <P>END OF QURANIC QUOTES</P>
 <P>he Quranic word used in these verses for sin is "dhanb", or "thanb", depending on how one transliterates the word. It is used many times in the Quran. The Hughes Encyclopedic Dictionary of Islam defines the word as "a sin or a crime, or the charge of such", [8].</P>
 <P>Clearly the Quran identifies Muhammad as a sinner. It is definitely applied to Muhammad. Since some Muslims argue that Muhammad was not a sinner, they have to resort to re-interpreting the Quranic word, "dhanb". So, what does that word "dhanb" mean in the context of the Quran? We have to address the true meaning of this word — is it "sin", meaning something that God will judge, or is it "fault" defined as meaning something that is very minor and easily excusable by God? To understand the context of the word, we should let the context of how the word is used throughout the Quran speak.
  We should let the Quran interpret itself.</P>
 <P>  I have found the word used about 39 times in the Quran. In some cases it is used without a reference, e.g. 3:31, "Say, "If you love God, follow me. God will love you and forgive your sins…". We have no reference as to what those "sins" consisted.</P>
 <P> However, "dhanb" is used many other times with a contextual reference.  Here is a significant selection.  I present about 22 of them because I want to establish exactly the Quran’s severity of this word.  And, I encourage all Muslims to search through their Quran to find an example of Allah lightly treating "dhanb".  Study the Quran to find something contrary to the harsh judgment that Allah proscribes to those who commit of "dhanb". I have found none.</P>
 <P>SELECTION OF QURANIC VERSES REGARDING "DHANB" OR SIN</P>
 <P>3:11     (Their plight will be) no better than that of the people of Pharaoh and their predecessors: they denied Our Signs and Allah called them to account for their sins. For Allah is strict in punishment.

    Allah called Pharaoh’s people to account for their sins, and they were punished for their "dhanb".</P>
 <P>3:16     (Namely) those who say: "Our Lord! we have indeed believed: forgive us then our sins and save us from the agony of the fire."

    Here we see people asking forgiveness for their "dhanb" because without forgiveness of their "dhanb" they will end up in the agony of fire (hell).</P>
 <P>5:18     (Both) the Jews and the Christians say: "We are sons of Allah and His beloved." Say: "Why then doth He punish you for your sins? Nay ye are but men,- of the men He hath created: He forgiveth whom He pleaseth and He punisheth whom He pleaseth: and to Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between: and unto Him is the final goal (of all)."

    Here Muhammad is saying that Christians and Jews are being punished by Allah for the "dhanb". Thus their "dhanb" earns punishment from Allah, not a wink of an eye.</P>
 <P>5:49     And this (He commands): Judge thou between them by what Allah hath revealed and follow not their vain desires but beware of them lest they beguile thee from any of that (teaching) which Allah hath sent down to thee. And if they turn away be assured that for some of their crimes it is Allah's purpose to punish them. And truly most men are rebellious.

    Here "dhanb" is defined as "crimes". Does any sincere person think that a criminal act is more than just a "mistake"? Of course not. How do you think God views "crimes".</P>
 <P>6:6       See they not how many of those before them We did destroy? Generations We had established on the earth in strength such as We have not given to you for whom We poured out rain from the skies in abundance and gave (fertile) streams flowing beneath their (feet): yet for their sins We destroyed them and raised in their wake fresh generations (to succeed them).

    God is destroying generations of people for their "dhanb".</P>
 <P>7:100   To those who inherit the earth in succession to its (previous) possessors is it not a guiding (lesson) that if We so willed We could punish them (too) for their sins and seal up their hearts so that they could not hear?

    Here the implication is that people could be punished by God for their "dhanb". "Dhanb" is worthy of punishment.</P>
 <P>8:52     "(Deeds) after the manner of the people of Pharaoh and of those before them: they rejected the signs of Allah and Allah punished them for their crimes: for Allah is strong and strict in punishment:

    Again, people were punished by God for their "dhanb = crimes". Allah is "strong and strict" in dishing out punishment for people’s "dhanb".</P>
 <P>Let’s review. "Dhanb" is translated as sin, crime, & fault. How does Allah deal with people who have committed dhanb? Allah -

 </P>
 <P>Obliterates them,

    Destroyed them,
    
    Puts them in hellfire,
    
    Gives them a grievous penalty,
    
    Calls them to account,
    
    Hits them with a violent tornado,
    
    Hits them with a mighty blast,
    
    Has the earth swallow them up,
    
    Drowns them in water,
    
    Punishes them,
    
    Puts them in the agony of fire.</P>
 <P>Allah does all this to people who commit "dhanb". Does this sound like something Allah passes over as a minor "stumbling", "mistake", or "act of forgetfulness"?</P>
 <P>   Of course not! It sounds like Allah is severely punishing people for their "dhanb". It sounds like Allah is really serious about it. Don’t you agree?</P>
 <P>And remember, Muhammad committed "dhanb". Muhammad was told to ask forgiveness for his "dhanb". And Muhammad taught in the Quran that forgiveness of "dhanb" was required to get into Paradise. Otherwise, a person with unforgiven "dhanb" ends up in hell.</P>
 <P>LIST OF SOME OF MUHAMMAD’S SINS

    Here is a listing of some of Muhammad’s sins:
    
    1)         The torturing and killing of a man just to get money:
    
    2)         Allowing female slaves to be raped:
    
    3)         Ordering the murder of a women who opposed him:
    
    4)         Ordering the murder of slave girls who had mocked him:
    
    5)         Speaking Satan’s words as God’s words:
    
                All of these sins were committed by Muhammad. No wonder he prayed for forgiveness. The truth was deep in his heart.</P>
 <P>ART 1 CONCLUSION:       MUHAMMAD WAS A SINNER

    Muhammad admitted he was a sinner. He called his sins "filth" and "evil". However, later Muslims invented an un-Islamic teaching that Muhammad was not a sinner. They did this primarily to elevate Muhammad to a level near equal to Jesus. Muhammad wa a sinner in the truest sense of the word. Even in his own theology his sins warranted God’s punishment unless they were forgiven.</P>
 <P>PART 2:     JESUS, CHRISTIANITY, AND SIN

    JESUS WAS NOT A SINNER
    
                Both Islam and Christianity teach that Jesus was not a sinner. In the Bible, it is explicitly stated that Jesus had no sin.</P>
 <P>FROM THE BIBLE

    Heb 4:14 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. 15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are--yet was without sin.
    
    2 Cor 5:20 We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God. 21 God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
    
    1 Peter 2:22 "He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth."
    
    1John 3:4 Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness. 5 But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin.
    
    FROM THE QURAN AND HADITH
    
                The Quran teaches that when Gabriel appeared to Mary to announce Christ’s birth, Gabriel said in Chapter 19:19:
    
    "He said: "Nay I am only a messenger from thy Lord (to announce) to thee the gift of a holy son."
    
                The word in Arabic for "holy" is zakiyya, a word with the root meaning "purity". This form of the word principally means "innocent, pure, clean, faultless".
    
    The Sahih Hadith also state that Jesus does not admit sin:
    
    Bukhari Vol. 6, #236
    
    ... 'So they will go to Jesus and say, 'O Jesus! You are Allah's Apostle and His Word which He sent to Mary, and a superior soul created by Him, and you talked to the people while still young in the cradle. Please intercede for us with your Lord. Don't you see in what state we are?' Jesus will say. 'My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before nor will ever become thereafter.' Jesus will not mention any sin ...
    
                Therefore, original Islam taught that Jesus had no sin. However, as stated earlier, later Muslims could not tolerate Muhammad’s inferiority and thus made up a doctrine that put Muhammad on par with Christ.
    
    In "Muslim Studies", Vol. 2, p. 346, I. Goldziher wrote:
    
                "An unconscious tendency prevailed to draw a picture of Muhammad that should not be inferior to the Christian picture of Jesus."
    
    This doctrine is actually contrary to Muhammad’s words in the Quran.</P>
 <P>FALSE PROPHECIES OF MUHAMMAD</P>
 <P>The Holy Bible gives us a test to determine a true prophet from a false one:</P>
 <P>"But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded him to say, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, must be put to death. You may say to yourselves, 'How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the LORD?' If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the LORD does not take place or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously. Do not be afraid of him." Deuteronomy 18:20-22</P>
 <P>In light of what God says in the preceding passage, we will examine several predictions made by Muhammad in the Quran and Islamic traditions to see if whether he passes God's test.</P>
 <P>On the Roman Conquest of Persia

    S. 30:2-4:
    
    "The Roman Empire has been defeated - in a land close by: But they, (even) after (this) defeat of theirs, will soon be victorious - within a few years."</P>
 <P>As the prophecy stated the Byzantines did become victorious over the Persians who had at first defeated them. Yet there are fundamental problems with this alleged prophecy:</P>
 <P>According to Yusuf Ali the Arabic word for "a few years," Bidh'un, signifies a period of three to nine years; yet according to the historical records the victory did not come until nearly fourteen years later. The Persians defeated the Byzantines and captured Jerusalem at about A.D. 614 or 615. The Byzantine counter-offensive did not begin until A.D. 622 and the victory was not complete until A.D. 628, making it a period between thirteen to fourteen years, not "a few years" alluded to in the Quran.</P>
 <P>Renowned historian and Muslim commentator, al-Tabari, places the Roman victory in 628 A.D. (6 A.H.), right after the signing of Hudaiybiya:</P>
 <P>According to Ibn Humayd- Salamah- Muhammad b. Ishaq- Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri- 'Ubaydallah b. 'Abdullah b. 'Utbah b. Mas'ud- 'Abdullah b. 'Abbas- Abu Sufyan b. Harb, who said: We were merchant folk. The warfare between us and the Messenger of God had prevented us from journeying, so that our wealth became depleted. After the truce between us and the Messenger of God, we feared that we might not encounter security. I set out for Syria with a group of merchants of Quraysh. Our specific destination was Gaza, and we arrived at the time of Heraclius' VICTORY over the Persians who were in his land - he expelled them and regained from them his Great Cross, which they had carried off. Having accomplished this against them and having received word that his cross had been rescued from them (he was staying at Hims), he set out from there on foot in thanksgiving to God for restoring it to him, to pray in Jerusalem. Carpets were spread out for him, and fragrant herbs were strewn on them. When he reached Jerusalem and performed his worship - with him were his military commanders and the nobles of the Romans - he arose troubled one morning, turning his gaze to the sky ... (The History of Al-Tabari: The Victory of Islam, translated by Michael Fishbein [State University of New York Press, Albany 1997], Volume VIII, pp. 100-101; bold and capital emphasis ours)</P>
 <P>The translator's footnote reads:</P>
 <P>436. "In 627 Heraclius invaded the Persian empire, and in December of that year won an important victory near ancient Ninevah, but had to retreat shortly afterwards. In February 628, however, the Persian emperor was assassinated, and the son who succeeded him desired peace. By about March 628 Heraclius could regard himself as victorious, but the negotiations for the evacuation of the Byzantine empire by the Persians were not completed until June 629. In September 629 Heraclius entered Constantinople AS VICTOR, and in March 630 restored the Holy Rood to Jerusalem." (Watt, Muhammad at Medina, 113-114). See also Ostrgorsky, History of the Byzantine State, 103-4. (Ibid., capital emphasis ours)</P>
 <P>The hadith collection of al-Bukhari provides further corroboration that Abu Sufyan's visit with Heraclius occurred after the signing of Hudaiybiya:</P>
 <P>Narrated ' Abdullah bin 'Abbas:
    That Abu Sufyan bin Harb Informed him that Heraclius called him and the members of a caravan from Quraish who had gone to Sham as traders, during the truce which Allah's Apostle had concluded with Abu Sufyan and the Quraish infidels. (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 53, Number 399)</P>
 <P>Watt places Rome's complete victory at 630 A.D., fifteen to sixteen years after the so-called prophecy was given!</P>
 <P>The original Quranic text had no vowel marks. Thus, the Arabic word Sayaghlibuna, "they shall defeat," could easily have been rendered, with the change of two vowels, Sayughlabuna, "they (i.e. Romans) shall be defeated." Since vowel points were not added until some time after this event, it could have been quite possible for a scribe to deliberately tamper with the text, forcing it to become a prophetic statement.</P>
 <P>This fact is solidified by Muslim commentator al-Baidawi. C.G. Pfander mentions Baidawi's comments on the variant readings surrounding this passage:</P>
 <P>"But Al Baizawi shatters the whole argument of the Muslims by informing us of certain varied readings in these verses of Suratu'r Rum. He tells us that some read غَلَبَتِ instead of the usual غُلِبَتِ, and سَيُغْلَبُونَ instead of سَيَغْلُبُونَ. The rendering will then be: 'The Byzantines have conquered in the nearest part of the land, and they shall be defeated in a small number of years'. If this be the correct reading, the whole story about Abu Bakr's bet with Ubai must be a fable, since Ubai was dead long before the Muslims began to defeat the Byzantines, and even long before the victories which Heraclius won over the Persians. This shows how unreliable such Traditions are. The explanation which Al Baizawi gives is, that the Byzantines became conquerors of 'the well-watered land of Syria' (على ريف آلْشام), and that the passage predicted that the Muslims would soon overcome them. If this is the meaning, the Tradition which records the 'descent' of the verses about six years before the Hijrah must be wrong, and the passage must belong to A.H. 6 at earliest. It is clear that, as the vowel points were not used when the Qur-an was first written down in Cufic letters, no one can be certain which of the two readings is right. We have seen that there is so much uncertainty about (1) the date at which the verses were 'sent down', (2) the correct reading, and (3) the meaning, that it is quite impossible to show that the passage contains a prophecy which was fulfilled. Hence, it cannot be considered to be a proof of Muhammad's prophetic office." (C. G. Pfander, Mizan-ul-Haqq - The Balance of Truth, revised and enlarged by W. St. Clair Tisdall [Light of Life P.O. Box 18, A-9503, Villach Austria], pp. 279-280; emphasis ours)</P>
 <P>This being the case, a Muslim cannot confidently tell us what the true reading of the text is and hence cannot insure us that this verse originally predicted the Byzantine victory over the Persians. Yet either rendering leaves us with a false prophecy within the Quran.</P>
 <P>It amazes us that a prophecy from God would not specify the exact time of the victory, seeing that God is all-knowing and all-wise, declaring the end from the beginning. When God specifies a time frame as an important part of a prophecy we would expect that it be precise, not a mere guess. For God to guess that the Byzantines would win at some time within "a few years" as opposed to specifying the exact year, is inconsistent with the belief in an Omniscient, Omnipotent Being. Hence, it is unlikely that the true God would actually make such a prophecy.</P>
 <P>Interestingly, the phrase "a few years" serves to further discredit this alleged prophecy. Abu Bakr believed the term "a few years" meant that the Byzantines were going to win in three years:</P>
 <P>"This passage refers to the defeat of the Byzantines in Syria by the Persians under Khusran Parvis. (A.D. 615 - 6 years before the Hegira). However, the defeat of the Persians should take place soon 'in a small number of years'. In the light of this prediction, Abu-Bakr undertook a bet with Ubai-ibn-Khalaf that this prediction would be fulfilled within three years, but he was corrected by Mohammed who stated that the 'small number' is between three and nine years (Al-Baizawi). Muslims tell us that the Byzantines overcame their enemies within seven years. The fact, however, is that the Byzantines defeated Persia in A.D. 628 (Al-Baizawi commentary). That was twelve years after the prediction of Mohammed. Consequently this passage does not qualify as a prophecy, particularly as the time between prophecy and fulfilment was far too short, and in addition the event was easily predictable." (Gerhard Nehls, Christians Ask Muslims [Life Challenge, SIM International; Africa, 1992], pp. 70-71)</P>
 <P>On Entering Mecca Sura 48:27 makes the following promise:</P>
 <P>"Truly did Allah fulfill the vision for His Messenger. Ye shall enter the Sacred Mosque, IF ALLAH WILLS, with minds secure, heads shaved, hair cut short, and without fear. For He knew what ye knew not, and He granted, besides this, a speedy victory."</P>
 <P>This verse was revealed in conjunction with the Muslims' failed attempt of entering Mecca to perform Tawaf (the ritual during Hajj of running between two mountains that was supposed to commemorate Hagar's fetching of water for Ishmael).
 On their way to the Ka'bah, they were met with a Meccan deputation headed by Suhail b. Amr who forbade the Muslims from completing their journey. This meeting then led to the signing of the treaty of Hudaibiya.</P>
 <P>Several problems arise from this whole incident. First, at the signing of the Hudaibiya treaty Muhammad agreed with the pagan Meccans to return to them those who had converted to Islam. At the same time Muhammad also bowed to their demands of replacing his signature of 'Muhammad, Messenger of God' with 'Muhammad, son of Abdullah' so that he might be allowed to make pilgrimage to Mecca the following year. The following is taken from Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 50, Number 891:</P>
 <P>"When Suhail bin Amr came, the Prophet said, ‘Now the matter has become easy.' Suhail said to the Prophet 'Please conclude a peace treaty with us.' So, the Prophet called the clerk and said to him, 'Write: By the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful." Suhail said, 'As for "Beneficent," by Allah, I do not know what it means. So write: By Your Name O Allah, as you used to write previously.' The Muslims said, 'By Allah, we will not write except: By the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful.' The Prophet said, 'Write: By Your Name O Allah.' Then he dictated, 'This is the peace treaty which Muhammad, Allah's Apostle has concluded.' Suhail said, 'By Allah, if we knew that you are Allah's Apostle we would not prevent you from visiting the Kaba, and would not fight with you. So, write: 'Muhammad bin Abdullah.' The Prophet said, 'By Allah! I am Apostle of Allah even if you people do not believe me. Write: Muhammad bin Abdullah.' (Az-Zuhri said, 'The Prophet accepted all those things, as he had already said that he would accept everything they would demand if it respects the ordinance of Allah, (i.e. by letting him and his companions perform 'Umra.)') The Prophet said to Suhail, 'On the condition that you allow us to visit the House (i.e. Ka'ba) so that we may perform Tawaf around it.' Suhail said, 'By Allah, we will not (allow you this year) so as not to give chance to the Arabs to say that we have yielded to you, but we will allow you next year.' SO, THE PROPHET GOT THAT WRITTEN.</P>
 <P>"Then Suhail said, 'We also stipulate that you should return to us whoever comes to you from us, even if he embraced your religion.' The Muslims said, 'Glorified be Allah! How will such a person be returned to the pagans after he has become a Muslim?'" (bold emphasis ours)</P>
 <P>One of those forced to return to Mecca with the pagans was Abu Jandal. In Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasulullah (The Life of Muhammad, trans. Alfred Guillaume, Oxford University Press), p. 505 we are told:</P>
 <P>'When Suhayl (the Meccan representative and the treaty's compiler) saw Abu Jandal he got up and hit him in the face and took hold of his collar, saying, 'Muhammad, the agreement between us was concluded before this man came to you.' He replied, 'you are right.' He began to pull him roughly by his collar and to drag him away to return him to Quraysh, while Abu Jandal shrieked at the top of his voice, 'Am I to be returned to the polytheists that they may entice me from my religion O Muslims?' and that increased the people's dejection'" (bold and italic emphasis ours)

    </P>
 <P>And:</P>
 <P>'While they were in this state Abu- Jandal bin Suhail bin 'Amr came from the valley of Mecca staggering with his fetters and fell down amongst the Muslims. Suhail said, 'O Muhammad! This is the very first term with which we make peace with you, i.e. you shall return Abu Jandal to me.' The Prophet said, 'The peace treaty has not been written yet.' Suhail said, 'I will never allow you to keep him.' The Prophet said, 'Yes, do.' He said, 'I won't do: Mikraz said, 'We allow you (to keep him).' Abu Jandal said, 'O Muslims! Will I be returned to the pagans though I have come as a Muslim? Don't you see how much I have suffered?'</P>
 <P>Abu Jandal had been [previously] tortured severely for the cause of Allah' (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 50, Number 891)</P>
 <P>We need to ask did Moses ever return a convert (especially one who was an Egyptian) back to the pagan Pharaoh in order to please the latter in obtaining what he wanted? Did Jesus ever compromise the truth of God by agreeing with the Pharisees in turning back all gentile seekers in order to be accepted by the Jewish ruling council? Would either Moses or Jesus go so far as to deny their apostleship in order to please the demands of pagans? Would these men refuse to glorify the true God in the manner commanded by the Creator and acquiesce to the request of addressing God in a manner pleasing to the unbelievers, much like Muhammad did?</P>
 <P>As one would expect the Muslims were enraged, especially Umar b. al-Khattab who rebuked Muhammad:</P>
 <P>'Umar bin al-Khattab said, 'I went to the Prophet and said, "Aren't you truly the messenger of Allah?" The Prophet said, "Yes, indeed." I said, "Isn't our cause just and the cause of the enemy unjust?" He said, "Yes." I said, "Then why should we be humble in our religion?" He said, "I am Allah's messenger and I do not disobey Him, and He will make me victorious"' (Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 50, Number 891)</P>
 <P>The anger of the Muslims is justifiable when we realize that Muhammad promised that his followers would have access to Mecca that very same year. When that did not occur, Muhammad attempted to justify his statement by stating, "Yes, did I tell you that we would go to Ka'ba this year?" (Ibid)</P>
 <P>In other words, since he did not specify when they would enter Mecca this cannot be considered a false prophecy! This is simply erroneous since the Muslim contingent was on their way to Mecca when a deputation from the pagan Arabs stopped them. In fact, one of Muhammad's demands in signing the treaty was that the pagans permit the Muslims to complete their journey to Mecca in order to perform Tawaf. Suhail denied Muhammad's request and instead made an agreement that the Muslims could enter Mecca the following year. Ibn Kathir further supports this in his commentary on S. 48:27:</P>
 <P>"In a dream, the Messenger of Allah saw himself entering Makkah and performing Tawaf around the House. He told his Companions about this dream when he was still in Al-Madinah. When they went to Makkah in the year of Al-Hudaybiyyah, none of them doubted that the Prophet's vision WOULD COME TRUE THAT YEAR. When the treaty of peace was conducted and they had to return to Al-Madinah that year, being allowed to return to Makkah the next year, SOME OF THE COMPANIONS DISLIKED WHAT HAPPENED. 'Umar bin Al-Khattab asked about THIS, saying, 'Haven't you told us that we will go to the House and perform Tawaf around it?'" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Abridged, Volume 9, Surat Al-Jathiyah to the end of Surat Al-Munafiqun, Abridged by a group of scholars under the supervision of Shaykh Safiur-Rahman Al-Mubarakpuri [Darussalam Publishers & Distributors, Riyadh, Houston, New York, London, Lahore; first edition, September 2000], p. 171; bold and capital emphasis ours)</P>
 <P>Al-Tabari writes:</P>
 <P>"While the Messenger of God was writing the document - he and Suhaly b. 'Amr - suddenly Abu Jandal, the son of Suhaly b. 'Amr, came walking with short steps in shackles. He had escaped to the Messenger of God. The companions of the Messenger of God had set out NOT DOUBTING that they would conquer, because of a vision the Messenger of God had seen. Therefore, when they saw what they saw - the peace, the retreat, and the obligations the Messenger of God had taken upon himself - the people felt so grieved about it that they were close to despair. When Suhayl saw Abu Jandal, he went up to him, struck him on the face, and grabbed him by the front of his garment. "Muhammad," he said, "the pact was ratified between me and you before this fellow came to you." "You are right," he replied. Suhayl began pulling and dragging [his son Abu Jandal] by the front of his garment to return him to Quraysh. Abu Jandal began screaming at the top of his voice, "People of the Muslims, shall I be returned to the polytheists for them to torment me for my religion?" This made the people feel even worse. The Messenger of God said: "Abu Jandal, count on a reward, for God will give you and those who are oppressed with you relief and a way out. We have made a treaty and peace between ourselves and these people; we have given them and they have given us a promise, and we will not act treacherously toward them." (The History of Al-Tabari: The Victory of Islam, Volume VIII, pp. 86-87; bold and capital emphasis ours)</P>
 <P>This proves that Muhammad actually believed he was going to enter into Mecca, a plan that never materialized. In order to save face he had to deny admitting that he actually implied that the Muslims would enter Mecca that same year.</P>
 <P>Second, to make matters worse Muhammad broke the treaty with the Meccans by refusing to return a Muslim convert from the Quraysh. This refusal was in clear violation of things expressly stipulated in the very document that Muhammad had agreed to sign:</P>
 <P>"Umm Kulthum Uqba b. Mu'ayt migrated to the apostle during this period. Her two brothers 'Umara and Walid sons of 'Uqba came and asked the apostle to return her to them in accordance with the agreement between him and Quraysh at Hudaybiyya, but he would not. God forbade it." (Sirat Rasulullah, p. 509; italic emphasis ours)</P>
 <P>Hence, Muhammad justified the breaking of his oath by claiming that it was God's will to do so. Unfortunately for Muslims, this would prove that Muhammad's God is not the God of the Holy Bible since breaking one's oath is strictly forbidden. (Cf. Numbers 30:1-2)

    In light of all these considerations we are again compelled to ask the following questions. Did Moses ever bow down to Pharaoh's requests in order to bring Israel out of bondage from Egypt? Did Jesus ever deny his Messiahship to gain access to the Temple? Did any true prophet of God ever compromise with the unbelievers in order to fulfill the will of God? Did these men proceed to break their oaths and promises in order to gain an unfair advantage over the unbelievers?
    
    One final problem with all this is that Muslims claim that every single word in the Quran was revealed directly by God to Muhammad through Gabriel. Based on this assumption Muslims further reason that one will not find Muhammad's words intermingled with the words of God. This being the case, how do Muslims explain the fact that S. 48:27 has Allah saying insha' Allah, i.e. "If Allah wills"? Does God not know what his will is? If so, is he uncertain whether his purpose shall come to pass necessitating him to then qualify his statement with the phrase, insha' Allah?
    
    One can understand how fallible humans who are unaware of God's purpose can qualify their statements with the expression "If God wills" (Cf. James 4:13-15). But for God to make such a qualification is beyond reasoning.
    
    Furthermore, if God is in fact speaking then whom is he referring to when he says "If Allah wills"? Is he addressing himself or someone else? If he is addressing someone else, than how many Gods are there? Or perhaps Allah is also a multi-personal Being seeing that there is more than one Person that make up the unity of Allah?
    
    This leads us to conclude that Muhammad's prediction not only failed to materialize, but that his motives in concocting revelation were power, money and fame. This verse also proves that God cannot be the author of the Quran.
    
    On the Appearance of the Antichrist and the End of the World
    
    Muhammad allegedly claimed that the Antichrist (called the Dajjal) was to appear shortly after the Muslim conquest of Constantinople. The following traditions are taken from the Sunan Abu Dawud:</P>
 <P>Book 37, Number 4281:</P>
 <P>Narrated Mu'adh ibn Jabal:

    The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: The flourishing state of Jerusalem will be when Yathrib is in ruins, the ruined state of Yathrib will be when the great war comes, the outbreak of the great war will be at the conquest of Constantinople and the conquest of Constantinople when the Dajjal (Antichrist) comes forth. He (the Prophet) struck his thigh or his shoulder with his hand and said: This is as true as you are here or as you are sitting (meaning Mu'adh ibn Jabal).</P>
 <P>Book 37, Number 4282:</P>
 <P>Narrated Mu'adh ibn Jabal:

    The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: The greatest war, the conquest of Constantinople and the coming forth of the Dajjal (Antichrist) will take place within a period of seven months.</P>
 <P>Book 37, Number 4283:</P>
 <P>Narrated Abdullah ibn Busr:

    The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: The time between the great war and the conquest of the city (Constantinople) will be six years, and the Dajjal (Antichrist) will come forth in the seventh.</P>
 <P>Accordingly, Muslims conquered Jerusalem in 636 AD. Constantinople was taken over by Muslims in May 1453 AD. Yet the prophecy regarding Yathrib (Medina) being in ruins and Antichrist's advent to take place seven months after the conquest of Constantinople did not materialize. Based on the preceding traditions Antichrist was to appear in November 1453.

    Some may wish to argue that these events refer to future conquests. For instance some may wish to say that Constantinople is used as a synonym for the Roman Christian Empire. This would therefore be predicting that Muslims are to takeover Rome before Antichrist appears.
    
    The problem with this is that if Muhammad was speaking of Rome he could have simply used the word Romans (Arabic: Ar-Rum). In fact, Romans/Ar-Rum is the name given to chapter 30 of the Quran. To call Rome either Constantinople or even Byzantium would be rather anachronistic. See above.</P>
 <P>Hence, in light of the preceding factors we are forced to conclude that Muhammad's predictions failed to materialize, thus disqualifying him regarding his claim to prophethood.</P>
 <P>Muhammad claimed that Jewish and Christian scriptures had predicted his coming (see, e.g., Qur’an 7:157). This has led Muslim apologists to comb the Old and New Testaments in search of passages that refer to their prophet. While all biblical evidence offered by Muslims in support of their prophet appears horribly strained to non-Muslims (provided the latter read the passages in context) and has been thoroughly refuted time and again, it is still common to hear Muslims claim that the Bible speaks about Muhammad.</P>
 <P>The most popular "prophecy" about Muhammad is found in Deuteronomy 18. It is quite ironic, then, to learn that, according to Deuteronomy 18, Muhammad can’t possibly be a prophet. As we will see, this puts Muslims in an awkward position, and helps show the lengths to which they will go in their efforts to defend their prophet.</P>
 <P>The purpose of this essay is to prove, based on Muslim claims (including their appeal to Deuteronomy 18), that Muhammad was a false prophet. I will begin by presenting two arguments against the prophethood of Muhammad, and I will follow this by carefully defending the arguments. Once I have shown that the arguments are sound, I will briefly discuss the options available to Muslims who want to reject the obvious conclusion.</P>
 <P> THE DEUTERONOMY DEDUCTIONS</P>
 <P>There are two elements to look for when examining deductive arguments: valid logic and true premises. To say that a deductive argument is valid is to say that, due to the logical form, true premises will always lead to a true conclusion. The most basic argument form is the syllogism, and the most basic valid form of the syllogism is Modus Ponens.[3] The logical form of the following arguments is Modus Ponens; thus, they are logically valid:</P>
 <P>Argument A—false gods and false prophets</P>
 <P>A1. If a person speaks in the names of false gods, that person is a false prophet.</P>
 <P>A2. Muhammad spoke in the names of false gods.</P>
 <P>A3. Therefore, Muhammad was a false prophet.</P>
 <P>Argument B—false revelations and false prophets</P>
 <P>B1. If a person delivers a revelation that doesn’t come from God, that person is a false prophet.</P>
 <P>B2. Muhammad delivered a revelation that didn’t come from God.</P>
 <P>B3. Therefore, Muhammad was a false prophet.</P>
 <P>Since the logic of both arguments is valid, true premises will always lead to a true conclusion. Hence, if the premises of these arguments are true, Muhammad was a false prophet. Let us turn, then, to a careful discussion of our premises.</P>
 <P>PREMISES A1 AND B1 DEFENDED</P>
 <P>A1 and B1 seem intuitively obvious. That is, it seems clear that if a person speaks in the names of false gods or delivers revelations that don’t come from God, the person cannot be a true prophet. Nevertheless, by appealing to the Bible to bolster their belief in Muhammad, Muslims have inadvertently granted that A1 and B1 are true.

    Deuteronomy 18 serves as the foundation of Islam’s "Argument from Biblical Prophecy," used by generations of Muslims to prove that Muhammad was a true prophet. Indeed, the popular Brief Illustrated Guide to Understanding Islam uses Deuteronomy 18 as its primary evidence that the Bible speaks of Muhammad. Author I. A. Ibrahim says,
    
    The Biblical prophecies on the advent of the Prophet Muhammad are evidence of the truth of Islam for people who believe in the Bible.
    
    In Deuteronomy 18, Moses stated that God told him: "I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers; I will put my words in his mouth, and he will tell them everything I command him. If anyone does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name, I myself will call him to account." (Deuteronomy 18: 18-19)[4]
    
    The book goes on to argue that Muhammad fulfilled this prophecy in numerous ways. While such claims have been refuted ad nauseum,[5] I will simply note that Muslims have here granted that Deuteronomy 18:18-19 is inspired by God (since they regard it as a miraculous prophecy). Surely, then, we can’t ignore the next verse, where God says:
    
    "But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in My name which I have not commanded him to speak, or which he speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die." (Deuteronomy 18:20)
    
    Here we have two criteria for spotting a false prophet: (1) delivering a revelation which God has not "commanded him to speak," and (2) speaking "in the name of other gods." Since Muslims who appeal to so-called biblical prophecies of Muhammad have given this passage their stamp of approval, they cannot deny the truth of A1 and B1. To sum up, Muslims have appealed to a passage in Deuteronomy 18, and that passage entails premises A1 and B1. Thus, according to Muslim claims, the first premise of each of the Deuteronomy Deductions is true.</P>
 <P>III. PREMISES A2 AND B2 DEFENDED

    We have seen that, according to a passage regarded by many Muslims as divine revelation, a person who either delivers a message that does not come from God or speaks in the names of false gods must be a false prophet. But this means that Muhammad was a false prophet, since he did both when he delivered the infamous "Satanic Verses."
    
    We learn about the Satanic Verses, not from Christian or Jewish sources, but from early Muslim writings. Accounts of the Satanic Verses are given in a number of early sources, including: (1) Ibn Ishaq, (2) Wakidi, (3) Ibn Sa’d, (4) al-Tabari, (5) Ibn Abi Hatim, (6) Ibn al-Mundhir, (7) Ibn Mardauyah, (8) Musa ibn 'Uqba, and (9) Abu Ma'shar.[6] According to the great Muslim scholar Ibn Hajar, three chains of transmission (isnad) in these accounts "satisfy the conditions requisite for an authentic report."[7] Moreover, Sahih al-Bukhari, Islam’s most trusted source on the life of Muhammad, gives indirect confirmation of the event (Number 4862, quoted below). Beyond this, certain verses of the Qur’an (17:73-5 and 22:52-3) were revealed in response to Muhammad’s embarrassing lapse into polytheism.
    
    We therefore have compelling historical evidence that the story is authentic. (For a thorough discussion of the evidence for the Satanic Verses, see "Muhammad and the Satanic Verses.") In fact, the historical method virtually guarantees the legitimacy of the story. Historians examining the lives of leaders and religious figures employ what is known as the "Principle of Embarrassment," a principle which also carries much weight in legal investigations. Law professor Annette Gordon-Reed sums up the principle thus: "Declarations against interest are regarded as having a high degree of credibility because of the presumption that people do not make up lies in order to hurt themselves; they lie to help themselves."[8] Applying the Principle of Embarrassment to accounts of the Satanic Verses, we see immediately that Muslims would not have invented this story, since it calls Muhammad’s reliability into question. We also see that the story couldn’t have been invented by non-Muslims; for if non-Muslims had invented the story, Muslims would have exposed the story’s origin, instead of defending it in their earliest historical works.</P>
 <P>The evidence for the general reliability of the Muslim accounts concerning the Satanic Verses is therefore too overwhelming to ignore. With this in mind, let us consider a condensed account of what happened, based on the History of al-Tabari.

    According to al-Tabari,</P>
 <P>When the Messenger of God saw how his tribe turned their backs on him and was grieved to see them shunning the message he had brought to them from God, he longed in his soul that something would come to him from God which would reconcile him with his tribe. With his love for his tribe and his eagerness for their welfare it would have delighted him if some of the difficulties which they made for him could have been smoothed out, and he debated within himself and fervently desired such an outcome. Then God revealed:</P>
 <P>By the Star when it sets, your comrade does not err, nor is he deceived; nor does he speak out of (his own) desire . . .

    and when he came to the words:
    
    Have you thought upon al-Lat and al-‘Uzza and Manat, the third, the other?
    
    Satan cast on his tongue, because of his inner debates and what he desired to bring to his people, the words:
    
    These are the high-flying cranes; verily their intercession is accepted with approval. (Al-Tabari, p. 108)</P>
 <P>he polytheists were delighted that Muhammad had at last approved of their gods. To return the kindness, they "prostrated themselves because of the reference to their gods which they had heard, so that there was no one in the mosque, believer or unbeliever, who did not prostrate himself" (p. 109).

    Muhammad’s friendly relations with the polytheists were short-lived, however, for he soon learned that his verses praising pagan idols came not from God, but from Satan. Saddened to recognize his treachery against Allah, Muhammad lamented: "I have fabricated things against God and have imputed to Him words which He has not spoken" (p. 111). Yet "Gabriel" comforted Muhammad, informing him that all prophets fall for Satan’s tricks from time to time. This staggering and unbelievable claim even found its way into the Qur’an:
    
    "And We did not send before you any apostle or prophet, but when he desired, the Shaitan made a suggestion respecting his desire; but Allah annuls that which the Shaitan casts, then does Allah establish His communications, and Allah is Knowing, Wise." (Surah 22:52)[9]
    
    According to the next verse, Allah allows his prophets to receive revelations from Satan in order to test hard-hearted people.
    
    Whatever we think of the preposterous Qur’anic explanation of the Satanic Verses (and its defense of Muhammad), it is clear that the Prophet of Islam, on at least one occasion, delivered a message that did not come from God. It is also clear that Muhammad, on at least one occasion, spoke in the names of false gods.[10] Thus, we can establish from Muslim sources that A2 and B2 are almost certainly true.</P>
 <P>Thus ibn taymiyyah is false on his attemt to prove muhammads prophethood. </p>
 <P>Ibn taymiyyah also claims:</P>
 <P>If it is said, “There are some verses in the Qur’an which
    assert that Muhammad is sent to the Arabs only, while
    some other verses state that his message is universal.
    Thus, there is a sense of contradiction between these
    verses.”
    If we assume that some Qur’anic verses imply that
    Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent to the Arabs
    only, while some other verses imply that his message is
    universal, this would be proof that his message was
    generalized after being confined to the Arabs. In this way,
    there is no contradiction between the verses. So how can
    their argument be accepted, bearing in mind that there is
    no single verse in the Qur’an to denote that Muhammad
    (peace be upon him) was sent to the Arabs only? Rather,
    it contains verses that say he was sent to the Arabs, for
    the Quraish and also for the people of the scripture. There
    is no contradiction at all between such verses.
    Sometimes, in the Qur’anAllah addresses the Christians
    and sometimes He addresses the Jews, but there is no
    contradiction between the two cases. Similarly, there are
    some verses in which Allah addresses the believers
    amongst the nation of Muhammad commanding them to
    adhere to the laws and doctrines of Islam, but there is no
    doubt that this address does not contradict the call
    directed to the people of the Scripture.
    Thus, the universality of the message of the Prophet
    (peace be upon him) should be an acknowledged fact,
    whether this acknowledgement is before or after the
    acknowledgement of his prophethood. The acknowledged
    facts that are known with extreme conviction cannot be
    among matters that are contradictory. That however, is
    44 • AL-JA WAB
    always the way of the people of innovation in religion from
    among those who have strayed from the people of the
    Scripture; they always follow the verses that are not
    entirely clear and abandon the ones that are entirely
    clear.
    If they say, “The verses of the Qur’an are contradictory
    and we only protest with that which concords with our
    aims, for our main purpose is to make manifest the
    contradiction of the Qur’an.”
    </P>
 <P>But this is also not true, if some verses suggest he was sent to only arabs and some verses say he went for all mankind this does indeed posit a sense of contradiction it wouldnt meanthat his message was generalized after being confined to the Arabs it would just mean the  quran has contradictions because we can see that the defenition of contradiction is : .</P>
 <P>a combination of statements, ideas, or features which are opposed to one another.</P>
 <P>Many ideas in quran are opposed to one another, thus the quran is full of contradictions. now lets prove that he was only a warned for arabs. (Contradicting ibn taymiyyah)</P>
 <P>MOHAMMED CLAIMED TO BE A WARNER ONLY FOR ARABIA</P>
 <P>1)
    "(Mohammed) You are only a Warner and for every nation there is a guide." (13:7)
    The principle given by the Quran here proves that as per his own standards Mohammed can only be a guide for his nation i.e. Arabs.
    
    2)
    "And we have sent no messenger but with the language of his people, that he might make (the message) clear for them." (14:4)
    This principle also proves that as per his own standards Mohammed can only be a guide for Arabic speaking people.
    
    3)
    "He is (Allah) who has raised among the unlettered people a messenger from among themselves" (62:2)
    So Mohammed claims only to be a prophet for "Umeen" the unlettered people of Arabia.
    
    It is also interesting to note here that "Umeen" could also mean people of Makkah (note-4).
    
     
    
    4)
    "And this (Quran) is a blessed book which we have revealed, confirming that which was (revealed) before it, so that you (O prophet) may warn the mother of the cities (Makkah) and those around her." (6:92)
    "And thus we have revealed to you an Arabic Quran, so that you may warn the mother of the cities (Makkah) and those around her." (42:7)</P>
 <P>The above verses clearly show that Mohammed claims to have received a revelation in Arabic to warn people of Makkah and those living close to it, of course the Arabic speaking people.</P>
 <P>5)
    "Then we gave Moses the book, complete for him who would do good, an explanation of all things, a guidance and a mercy, so that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord." (6:154)
    "And this (Quran) is a blessed book which we have revealed, so follow it and fear Allah that you may receive mercy." (6:155)
    
    "Lest you (pagan Arabs) should say: The book was sent down to the two sects before us (the Jews and the Christians) and for our part we were in fact unaware of what they studied (because that book was in a different language)." (6:156)</P>
 <P>These verses claim that the book given to Moses was complete. The Quran was revealed because the book of Moses was in a language foreign to the Arabs and they could have made this as an excuse for not following the book of Moses.</P>
 <P>6)
    "Verily, We made it a Quran in Arabic so that you may be able to understand" (43:3)
    This verse is clear enough to prove that Quran is in Arabic so that Arabs can understand it.
    
    To say that this book is for non Arabic speaking people is as ridiculous as telling a Japanese person, "I have written this book in English so that you can understand."
    
     </P>
 <P>In the following we will take a look at the scriptural support cited by the Muslim theologians who claim universality for Mohammed's Prophethood and the Quran.

    But before examining their reasons I would present an analogy that I feel may be useful.
    
    A person comes to India when the British ruled it. This person claims, "I am a special representative of the Queen, sent to deliver this message to the people of India. I have been given this message in Hindi so that you can understand it."
    
    Some other day he stands in the downtown of the Indian capital and delivers a speech and says "O people I have been sent as a special messenger from the Queen to you all".
    
    Everybody understands that "O people" and "you all" here means only the people of India although the words are general but they give a restricted meaning because that person has clearly mentioned his scope earlier.
    
    At another time while making an address to people at the same place he says, "I have come to deliver this message to you and to whom it reaches".
    
    Every one would understand that "whom it reaches" is not general here either but is restricted to the people of India as that person has mentioned his scope clearly.
    
    On the basis of the initial six points showing the scope as presented by the Qur'an itself together with the above analogy let us attempt to understand the following verses of the Quran appealed to by the Muslim theologians:</P>
 <P>1)
    "Say (O Mohammed): O people! Verily, I am sent to you all as the messenger of Allah." (7:158)
    "And we have not sent you (O Mohammed) except as a giver of glad tidings and a Warner to all people." (34:28)
    
    "The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for people and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion" (2:185)
    
    The above verses in the light of the above six points would mean that prophethood is for all people of Arabia.
    
     </P>
 <P>2)
    "This Quran has been revealed to me that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach." (6:19)
    This verse would mean those from Arabia to whom it reaches.</P>
 <P>3)
    "Thus we made You a Just group, that you be witness over people and the messenger be a witness over you." (2:143)
    Means that group of Muslims is witness over all people of Arabia or that Muslims are a witness over former nations on the day of Judgement to whom prophets were sent that those prophets delivered their message and the Muslims know this from the Quran. (The latter interpretation is from a Hadith in Bukhari (Kitab-ut-Tafsir), 6.14).
    
     </P>
 <P>4)
    "You (Muslims) are the best group raised for the people." (3:110)
    Meaning for the people of Arabia.</P>
 <P>5)
    "Blessed is He who sent down the criterion to His slave that he may be a warner for the Aalameen." (25:1)
    "And we have sent you not but as a mercy for the Aalameen" (21:107)
    
    "It (this Quran) is only a reminder for the Aalameen." (38:87, 12:104, 6:90, and 81:27)</P>
 <P>These above verses are also quoted but are not useful as their force is dependent on the interpretation of the word "Aalameen".</P>
 <P>In Arabic the root of "Aalameen" is "Ain", "Lam", and "Mem" meaning knowledge. In Arabic there is a form of noun known as "Ism-e-Aala" and it is formed on "Fa-Alunn" so from this root "Ism-e-Aala" is "Aalamunn" which means "Ma Uulamu behi" (Raghib) i.e. "The thing from which knowledge of another thing is obtained." Since it is thought that knowledge about God is obtained from the universe, it is known as an "Aalamunn." But then, the universe is a combination of so many things and knowledge of God is obtained from each one of them so they are all also individually called an "Aalamunn" and in this way the universe becomes a plural, i.e. "Aalameen". However, this plural is not always used for the entire universe only, it may also be used for a combination of any three or more "Aalamunn" (in Arabic plural is used for three or more).</P>
 <P>In this way every human is also an "Aalamunn" as it is thought that the knowledge of God is obtained from the existence of each human being and therefore any three or more persons are "Aalameen". Raghib (died 502 Hijrah) in Mufridat-ul-Quran quotes Jaffer Sadiq (The Son of Zain-Ul-Abideen the son of Hussein the Son of Fatimah the Daughter of Muhammad) to agree with the same that every human is an "Aalamunn".</P>
 <P>The restricted meaning of Aalameen is also used in the Quran, for example in:</P>
 <P>"O Children of Israel! Remember my favour which I bestowed upon you and that I gave you superiority over the Aalameen." (2:47)</P>
 <P>Here "Aalameen" cannot encompass all people of all times (let alone the entire universe) since it would be in contradiction to:</P>
 <P>"You (Muslims) are the best group." (3:110)
    How can Muslims be the best group if "Aalameen" in 2:47 includes people of all times?</P>
 <P>And

    "And Ishmael and Al-Yasa, and Jonah and Lot, and each one of them we gave Superiority over the Aalameen." (6:86)
    </P>
 <P>How can Ishmael and Lot be included in the "Aalameen" in 2:47 and if they are how can Children of Ishmael be included in the "Aalameen" here as they both are not from the Children of Israel?

    For other examples of the restricted meaning of "Aalameen" see note 5.
    
    Thus the context and overall coherence of the theme determines the meaning of "Aalameen" in any given passage.
    
    In the light of the six points mentioned above, "Aalameen" in the above verses used by Muslim theologians would mean the people of Arabia. This interpretation is permissible by the language and maintains the coherence and harmony of the meaning of Quran and therefore is the best interpretation.
    
     </P>
 <P>Thus you will note that in consideration of the six points presented above it is very clear that Mohammed claimed to be a Warner only for Arabia and to have received a revelation for them in Arabic so that they can understand it.</P>
 <P>(This is a refutation till the page 82)</P>
 <P>ibn taymiyyah claimed: </P>
 <P>The fact that a nation had received a Messenger does not
    necessarily mean that they should not receive another
    one. </P>
 <P>This i agree with but we have a bible verse that disproves of this 1 galatians 1:8-9 8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. disproving prophethood of muhammad.</P>
 <P>Ibn taymiyyah also claims that the gospels werent written by witnesses and that they arent authenthic, lets debunk this: </P>
 <P>The Testimony of the Very Early Church as tothe Reliability of the Canonical Gospels

    Many factors affirm the absolute reliability of the Gospels.  At the outset, one must know that the consistent testimony of the early church in the beginning centuries of its existence stands as a firm, inviolable witness to the absolute truthfulness, accuracy, and reliability of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, especially the four Gospels of Matthew, Luke, Mark, and John.  Importantly, the testimony of the early church stands in direct contradiction to the negative, modern criticism of the Gospels that developed so much later in the eighteenth century to the twenty-first century.  What can we learn when we examine these early church records? Those who lived closest to the time of Jesus knew with certainty of the assuredness of the Gospel record.  What can we learn from this early Christian testimony?
    First, the four canonical Gospels, Matthew, Luke, Mark, and John were unanimously affirmed by the earliest orthodox or “catholic” Christian communities throughout the Roman Empire, wherever Christianity had spread, as thoroughly investigated, wholly undisputed, and never doubted in any manner.[1]  The first great church historian, Eusebius (ca. AD 260-341), as well as many other very early church fathers, leave us a thrilling record about the genuineness Gospels from which the church derives its information.  Eusebius called the four canonical Gospels “the holy four Gospels” that were never once doubted by anyone whatsoever in the orthodox church as coming from the Apostles whose names they bore.[2] The early fathers knew that the Gospel of Matthew was written by Levi the tax collector,3 that Mark, the companion and interpreter of Peter, took Peter’s preaching and made it into the Gospel that bears Marks name, that Luke, Paul’s personal traveling companion as seen in the “we” sections of Acts (e.g Acts16:10-18; ), composed a two-part series known as Luke-Acts (Luke 1:1-4)[4]; and John the Apostle wrote the Gospel that bears his name. [5] Eusebius tells us that an unbroken chain of custody in the early church, just like modern legal forensics, consisting of orthodox bishops throughout the entire Roman world, from the AD first to the fourth centuries, affirmed these four Gospels, and only these four Gospels, as genuinely from the men whose names they bore.
    
    Second, from the earliest times (AD 125), these Gospels, while anonymous in their text, actually bore titles on all their manuscripts, “The Gospel according to Matthew,” “the Gospel According to Mark,” “The Gospel According to Luke,” “the Gospel According to John.”  No other names ever appeared on any manuscripts.  From the earliest beginnings, the orthodox church was very, very careful to guard these four Gospels as the only true witnesses to Jesus’s life.  They firmly rejected all other gospels as false, so that the anonymous nature of these four Gospels are actually a strong testimony to whose names they bear. The earliest fathers authoritatively quoted these four Gospels, demonstrating their unwavering belief in the full trustworthiness and accuracy of these four Gospel records of Jesus’s life.  About these four gospels, the early church knew with certainty that they were written testimonies by the first-century disciples of Jesus whose names were attached to them.
    Third, the early fathers even left a clear record even of the chronological order in which they were written.  Clement of Alexandria (AD 150-215) wrote that the Gospels with genealogies (Matthew and Luke) were written before the Gospels without (Mark and John).[6] They tell us always without fail that Matthew wrote first.  Moreover, Irenaeus tells us that John the Apostle wrote his Gospel last.  So, the chronological order of the Gospels is Matthew wrote, then Luke, then Mark, and finally John wrote his testimony.[7]
    
    Finally, and most importantly, the summary impact of the certain testimony of the early church as they testified to the canonical Gospels cannot be overstated.  Matthew, Luke, Mark, John were written either by direct apostolic eyewitnesses (Matthew, John) or based on apostolic eyewitness testimony (Mark—based on Peter’s preaching and Luke [Luke 1:1-4) based on interviewing eyewitnesses and as a companion of Paul [Acts]).  When any Christian reads these four Gospels, they are literally “sitting at the feet” of Jesus, as well as listening to eyewitness reports of men and women who knew him directly, intimately, accompanying Him from his birth (Matt 1-3; Luke 1-3) through his ministry (Matt 4-27; Luke 3-23; Mark 1-15; John 1-19) to his resurrection and ascension to heaven (Matt 28; Luke 24; Mark 16; John 20-21; Acts 1). 
    
    Some Bible critics argue that we should disregard the Bible because it’s
    impossible that our modern versions could match the original texts. But how does this
    argument stand up to scrutiny? The Bible was not translated into English until the late
    1300s.1 Did the Bible change over the many centuries up until then? How was the Bible
    actually put together? How do we know that the Bible contains the books that it should
    have? These are important questions, and many books have been written to address them.
    These questions concern the canon—the group or list of books that are considered to be
    inspired by God. The word canon is originally from a Semitic word, qanehin Hebrew.It
    meant “reed” or “stalk,” which is how it is used in Job 40:21 and 1 Kings 14:15. From
    this it conveys a secondary meaning of something with which to measure, a standard or
    benchmark. The word then found its way into Greek, where it took the form kanon. And
    through Greek and into the Latin canna, it comes to us in the English form of canon – not
    to be confused, of course, with the large, heavy military gun known as a cannon (a word
    which also derives from the root meaning “reed” because it is a tube).
    The dictionary states that other meanings of canon include regulations, principles,
    rules or standards of judgment. These bring us back to the ancient meaning of a measure,
    standard or benchmark—in this case the issue of which writings meet the standard or
    benchmark of being considered part of the inspired, hand-recorded Word of God. The
    word Bible comes to us again through Latin from the Greek word biblia, meaning “books.” It contains the books (originally written on scrolls) that are acknowledged or understood to be the canonical—divinely inspired—books of God. One might say,
    accurately, that they are the standard by which every human being should live. As the
    apostle Paul wrote to his fellow minister Timothy in 2 Timothy 3:15-17: “From
    childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for
    salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
    Textual criticism” is the field of study in which experts compare the various
    manuscripts in existence to one another, seeking to come as close as possible to what the
    original author wrote. The original manuscripts are called ”autographs,” literally “self
    writings.” Today, with the passage of so much time, no autographs—original copies—
    exist of any of the Old or New Testament books. Over the centuries minor differences
    (called variants) often make their way into successive copies of handwritten documents,
    even with the greatest of care of the scribes involved. Thus, the field of study called
    textual criticism exists to try to identify these variations and determine what the original
    texts said.
    
    After 1455 and Johannes Gutenberg’s invention of the first movable metal type
    printing press, the Bible could be printed over and over again with predictable accuracy,
    so variants no longer were a concern. However, before that time manuscripts still had
    variants. Thus the period before 1455 is where textual criticism comes into play. Because
    of the strict requirements and few locations where the Old Testament was copied, few variants or versions of the Old
    Testament ever came into existence. When the Dead Sea Scrolls (primarily portions of
    the Old Testament dating mostly from the first century B.C.) were discovered in 1947,
    many people were initially concerned that they would show marked differences with the
    Masoretic Text of the Old Testament. Because the Dead Sea Scrolls were a thousand
    years older than the oldest and most reliable Masoretic Text we have today (the
    Leningrad Codex, dating to A.D. 1008), scholars thought they might find drastic
    differences over that long passage of time. But did they? After years of study, they found that the Dead Sea Scrolls they examined have
    only a relatively few minor, insignificant differences from today’s Masoretic Text of the
    Old Testament. “These oldest-known Biblical texts have one absolutely crucial feature,”
    explains
    historian Ian Wilson. “Although . . . a thousand years older than the texts previously
    available in Hebrew, they show just how faithful the texts of our present Bibles are to
    those from two thousand years ago and how little they have changed over the centuries.6
    Two Isaiah scrolls, for instance, contain the Isaiah text almost exactly as it is in our
    present-day Bibles . . . “Although there are, as we might expect, some minor differences,
    these are mostly the interchange of a word or the addition or absence of a particular
    phrase. For example, whereas in present-day Bibles Isaiah 1:15 ends, ‘Your hands are
    covered in blood’, one of the Dead Sea pair adds, ‘and your fingers with crime’. Where
    Isaiah 2:3 of our present day Bibles reads, ‘Come, let us go up to the mountain of [the
    LORD]’, to the house of the God of Jacob’, the Dead Sea Scroll version omits, ‘to the
    mountain of [the LORD]’. “Such discrepancies are trifling, and there can be no doubt that
    the Biblical books someone stored away so carefully at Qumran two thousand years ago
    were as close to those we know in our present Hebrew and Old Testament Bibles as
    makes no difference.
    Where there are differences, however, this does not mean the Dead Sea Scrolls
    were correct and the Masoretic Text incorrect. We should keep in mind that the Dead Sea
    Scrolls were not necessarily transcribed with the same meticulous preservation practices
    as those used by the main scribes of the time. Nonetheless, the remarkable discovery of
    the Dead Sea Scrolls is astounding confirmation that the Old Testament has indeed been
    accurately preserved for us today
    
    HOW DO WE KNOW THE BIBLE IS ACCURATE AND INFALLIBLE?
    How can you be sure that the Bible is the same now as when it was written?
    The Bible has been copied and translated so many times! Haven't you ever played
    the game where people sit in a circle and pass a sentence from one person to the
    next until it comes back around in a completely distorted version? If that could
    happen in a room in just a few minutes, think of all the errors and changes that
    must have filled the Bible in the centuries since it was first written!9
    There are three lines of evidence that support the claim that the biblical documents
    are reliable: these are the bibliographic test, the internal test, and the external test. The
    first test examines the biblical manuscripts, the second test deals with the claims made by
    the biblical authors, and the third test looks to outside confirmation of the biblical
    content The Bibliographic TestThe Quantity of Manuscripts: In the case of the Old Testament, there is a small number
    of Hebrew manuscripts, because the Jewish scribes ceremonially buried imperfect and
    worn manuscripts. Many ancient manuscripts were also lost or destroyed during Israel's
    turbulent history. Also, the Old Testament text was standardized by the Masoretic Jews
    by the sixth century A.D., and all manuscripts that deviated from the Masoretic Text were
    evidently eliminated. But the existing Hebrew manuscripts are supplemented by the Dead
    Sea Scrolls, the Septuagint (a third century B.C. Greek translation of the Old Testament),
    the Samaritan Pentateuch, and the Targums (ancient paraphrases of the Old Testament),
    as well as the Talmud (teachings and commentaries related to the Hebrew Scriptures).
    The quantity of New Testament manuscripts is unparalleled in ancient literature. There
    are over 5,000 Greek manuscripts, about 8,000 Latin manuscripts, and another 1,000
    manuscripts in other languages (Syriac, Coptic, etc.).
    In addition to this extraordinary
    number, there are tens of thousands of citations of New Testament passages by the early
    church fathers. In contrast, the typical number of existing manuscript copies for any of
    the works of the Greek and Latin authors, such as Plato, Aristotle, Caesar, or Tacitus,
    ranges from one to 20. The Quality of Manuscripts: Because of the great reverence the Jewish scribes held
    toward the
    Scriptures, they exercised extreme care in making new copies of the Hebrew Bible. The
    entire scribal process was specified in meticulous detail to minimize the possibility of
    even the slightest error. The number of letters, words, and lines were counted, and the
    middle letters of the Pentateuch and the Old Testament were determined. If a single
    mistake was discovered, the entire manuscript would be destroyed. As a result of this
    extreme care, the quality of the manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible surpasses all other
    ancient manuscripts. “The 1947 discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls provided a significant
    check on this, because these Hebrew scrolls antedate the earliest Masoretic Old
    Testament manuscripts by about 1,000 years. But in spite of this time span, the number of
    variant readings between the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Masoretic Text is quite small, and
    most of these are variations in spelling and style.”10 While the quality of the Old
    Testament manuscripts is excellent, that of the New Testament is very good--
    considerably better than the manuscript quality of other ancient documents. Because of
    the thousands of New Testament manuscripts, there are many variant readings, but these
    variants are actually used by scholars to reconstruct the original readings by determining
    which variant best explains the others in any given passage. Some of these variant
    readings crept into the manuscripts because of visual errors in copying or because of
    auditory errors when a group of scribes copied manuscripts that were read aloud. Other
    errors resulted from faulty writing, memory, and judgment, and still others from wellmeaning scribes who thought they were correcting the text. Nevertheless, only a smallnumber of these differences affect the sense of the passages, and only a fraction of thesehave any real consequences. Furthermore, no variant readings are significantenough to call into question any of the doctrines of the New Testament. The New Testament can be regarded as 99.5 percent pure, and the correct readings for the remaining 0.5percent can often be ascertained with a fair degree of probability by the practice of textual criticism. 
    
    The Time Span of Manuscripts: Apart from some fragments, the earliest Masoretic
    manuscript of the Old Testament is dated at A.D. 895. This is due to the systematic
    destruction of worn manuscripts by the Masoretic scribes. However, the discovery of the
    Dead Sea Scrolls dating from 200 B.C. to A.D. 68 drastically reduced the time span from
    the writing of the Old Testament books to our earliest copies of them. The time span of
    the New Testament manuscripts is exceptional. The manuscripts written on papyrus came
    from the second and third centuries A.D. The John Rylands Fragment (P52) of the Gospel   of John is dated at A.D. 117-38, only a few decades after the Gospel was written. The
    Bodmer Papyri are dated from A.D. 175-225, and the Chester Beatty Papyri date from
    about A.D. 250.11 The time span for most of the New Testament is less than 200 years
    (and some books are within 100 years) from the date of authorship to the date of our
    earliest manuscripts. This can be sharply contrasted with the verage gap of over 1,000
    years between the composition and the earliest copy of the writings of other ancient
    authors. To summarize the bibliographic test, the Old and New Testaments enjoy far
    greater manuscript attestation in terms of quantity, quality, and time span than any other
    ancient documents. It is especially interesting to make specific comparisons between the
    New Testament and other writings. 
    
    
    The Internal Test
    The second test of the reliability of the biblical documents asks, "What claims
    does the Bible make about itself?" This may appear to be circular reasoning. It sounds
    like we are using the testimony of the Bible to prove that the Bible is true. But we are
    really examining the truth claims of the various authors of the Bible and allowing them to
    speak for themselves. (Remember that the Bible is not one book but many books woven
    together.) This provides significant evidence that must not be ignored. A number of biblical authors claim that their accounts are primary, not secondary.
    That is, the bulk of the Bible was written by people who were eyewitnesses of the events
    they recorded. John wrote in his Gospel, "And he who has seen has borne witness, and
    his witness is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe"
    (John 19:35; see 21:24). In his first epistle, John wrote, "What was from the beginning,
    what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we beheld and our hands
    handled concerning the Word of life . . . what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you
    also" (1 John 1:1, 3). Peter makes the same point abundantly clear: "For we did not
    follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our
    Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty" (2 Peter 1:16; also see Acts
    2:22; 1 Peter 5:1). The independent eyewitness accounts in the New Testament of the life,
    death, and resurrection of Christ were written by people who were intimately acquainted
    with Jesus Christ. Their gospels and epistles reveal their integrity and complete
    commitment to the truth, and they maintained their testimony even through persecution
    and martyrdom. All the evidence inside and outside the New Testament runs contrary to
    the claim made by form criticism that the early church distorted the life and teachings of
    Christ. Most of the New Testament was written between A.D. 47 and 70, and all of it was
    complete before the end of the first century. There simply was not enough time for myths
    about Christ to be created and propagated. And the multitudes of eyewitnesses who were
    alive when the New Testament books began to be circulated would have challenged
    blatant historical fabrications about the life of Christ. The Bible places great stress on
    accurate historical details, and this is especially obvious in the Gospel of Luke and the
    Book of Acts, Luke's two-part masterpiece (see his prologue in Luke 1:1-4).
    The External Test
    Because the Scriptures continually refer to historical events, they are verifiable;
    their accuracy can be checked by external evidence. The chronological details in the
    prologue to Jeremiah (1:1-3) and in Luke 3:1-2 illustrate this. Ezekiel 1:2 allows us to
    date Ezekiel's first vision of God to the day (July 31, 592 B.C.). The historicity of Jesus
    Christ is well-established by early Roman, Greek, and Jewish sources, and these
    extrabiblical writings affirm the major details of the New Testament portrait of the Lord.
    The first-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus made specific references to John the
    Baptist, Jesus Christ, and James in his Antiquities of the Jews. In this work, Josephus
    gives us many background details about the Herods, the Sadducees and Pharisees, the
    high priests like Annas and Caiaphas, and the Roman emperors mentioned in the gospels
    and Acts. We find another early secular reference to Jesus in a letter written a little after
    A.D. 73 by an imprisoned Syrian named Mara Bar-Serapion. This letter to his son
    compares the deaths of Socrates, Pythagoras, and Christ. Other first- and second-century
    writers who mention Christ include the Roman historians Cornelius Tacitus (Annals) and
    Suetonius (Life of Claudius, Lives of the Caesars), the Roman governor Pliny the
    Younger (Epistles), and the Greek satirist Lucian (On the Death of Peregrine). Jesus is
    also mentioned a number of times in the Jewish Talmud.
    CONCLUSION
    The crux of the matter is that, whether or not man believes does not change the
    accurate state of the scripture. One can always lean on the testimony of 2Tim 3:16a. The
    superintendence of the Holy Spirit makes the Bible accurate despite the human writers’
    style and languages of compilation.
    </P>
 <P> ( this is a refute till page 106) - well mostly other texts also debunked parts of it but whatever. moving to chapter 2</P>
 <P>Later ibn taymiyyah just misquotes a verse Matthew 28:19 lets debunk him ( till page 115)</P>
 <P>In response to this argument, one could argue that the passage misunderstands the doctrine of the Trinity and the meaning of the word "name" in the Great Commission. The word "name" in the Great Commission could be understood as referring to the three persons of the Trinity, rather than a single name. Additionally, the doctrine of the Trinity does not teach that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three names for the same God, but rather that they are three distinct persons who share one divine nature. This understanding of the Trinity is consistent with the language of the Great Commission and with other passages in the Bible that speak of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as distinct persons.</P>
 <P>What does matthew 28:19 mean?</P>
 <P>In Matthew's story of Jesus, these are His parting words to His eleven remaining disciples. Verses 18–20 are often called the "Great Commission" because Jesus is sending His hand-chosen disciples out into the world to accomplish a specific mission: Make more disciples. This comes with some noteworthy inclusions, but what is also crucial are things which Jesus does not say.</P>
 <P>Specifically, the disciples are to make more disciples of all nations. This means people from every people group and ethnicity on earth. Through Jesus, God's relationship with humanity has moved beyond Israel to include people from every corner of the world who come to the Father through the Son.
</P>
 <P>Jesus' command is to make "disciples." A disciple is someone who becomes like his or her master by living in a servant relationship to him. They learn from and submit to that person's example. That's what each of the eleven disciples hearing this for the first time had done in answer to Jesus' call. It is now what they will invite others to participate in from around the world.</P>
 <P>Discipleship to Jesus involves at least the two things Jesus mentions in this command: baptism and obedience. The disciples are commanded to baptize new disciples in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The choice to be publicly baptized is evidence that someone has believed in Jesus and made the commitment to follow Him. The disciples were given the authority to baptize that person in the name of God, declaring that person's position in the eternal family of God.</P>
 <P>Notable is that Jesus does not command His disciples to "print Bibles," or anything similar. The written Word of God is our ultimate reference for matters of faith (1 Corinthians 4:6; Acts 17:11). It was intended for that purpose by God (2 Timothy 3:16–17). It is not meant to be the only means, or even the primary means, by which new Christians learn about faith (Acts 8:30–31). The primary work of the Great Commission is to "make disciples," which means the cooperative, mentoring process we now refer to as "discipleship" (Acts 18:24–28; Hebrews 10:25; 13:7).</P>
 <P>(this is a debunk till page 120) Finally i agree with many pages of ibn taymiyyahs debunks on christians but i believe that the objections were far to bad to even consider refuting so  i dont believe ibn taymiyyah did a good job. ill just get to the part of refuting him on arguments within christianity.</P>
 <P>Lets refute his arguments against christianity.</P>
 <P>One way to refute the argument against the Christian belief in the Three Entities being One God is to challenge the assumption that the concept of divine simplicity is incompatible with the Trinity. While it is true that the principle of divine simplicity states that God is simple in essence and cannot be divided into distinct components, it is possible to interpret the three persons of the Trinity as distinct modes or aspects of one simple divine essence. This interpretation allows for the possibility of multiple persons in the Godhead without compromising the simplicity of God's essence.</P>
 <P>Another way to refute the argument is to challenge the assumption that the concept of divine simplicity is a necessary principle in Christian theology. While many Christian theologians have affirmed the principle of divine simplicity, not all have done so. Some theologians have argued that the concept of divine simplicity is not essential to Christian doctrine and can be dispensed with without compromising the fundamental tenets of the faith.</P>
 <P>A third way to refute the argument is to challenge the assumption that the concept of the divine nature and attributes is incompatible with the Trinity. While it is true that the Christian doctrine of the Trinity implies that there are multiple divine persons, it does not necessarily follow that there are multiple divine natures or attributes. The three persons of the Trinity share the same divine nature and attributes, and are not separate entities with distinct natures or attributes.</P>
 <P>A fourth way to refute the argument is to challenge the assumption that the concept of the divine nature and attributes is a necessary principle in Christian theology. While many Christian theologians have affirmed the concept of the divine nature and attributes, not all have done so. Some theologians have argued that the concept of the divine nature and attributes is not essential to Christian doctrine and can be dispensed with without compromising the fundamental tenets of the faith.</P>
 <P>The Trinity and Divine Simplicity: The doctrine of divine simplicity asserts that God is not composed of parts but is identical with his divine nature, attributes, and existence. This is a philosophical and theological concept that has been debated and interpreted in various ways within Christian thought. Some theologians argue that the Trinity is compatible with divine simplicity because the three persons of the Trinity share one divine essence, nature, and will. The distinctions within the Godhead are not in the essence but in the relations between the persons. Thus, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not three gods but one God in three persons. This relational distinction does not introduce complexity or composition into the divine essence, which remains simple according to this view.

    The Trinity and Monotheism: The Christian understanding of the Trinity is rooted in monotheism. Christians do not worship three gods but affirm that there is only one divine being who exists eternally as three distinct persons. The oneness of God is not numerical but ontological. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one in being (homoousios) and share the same divine attributes perfectly and completely. The doctrine of the Trinity seeks to maintain both the unity of God and the distinctness of the three persons, avoiding modalism (which denies the real distinctions between the persons) and tritheism (which posits three separate gods).
    
    The Incarnation and the Two Natures of Christ: The Christian belief in the Incarnation—that Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man—is another point of contention. The Council of Chalcedon (451 AD) affirmed that Christ has two natures, divine and human, united in one person without confusion, change, division, or separation. This doctrine maintains that in the Incarnation, the eternal Son of God assumed a human nature, so that Jesus Christ is one person with two distinct but inseparable natures. This is a mystery that is not fully comprehensible to human reason but is believed to be a divine revelation.
    
    The Holy Spirit as a Distinct Person: The Holy Spirit is understood as a distinct person of the Trinity, not merely an attribute or force emanating from God. The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father (and the Son, according to Western Christian tradition) and is worshiped and glorified together with the Father and the Son. The Holy Spirit's role in inspiring Scripture, empowering believers, and working in creation and redemption demonstrates personal attributes and actions.
    
    The Economic and Immanent Trinity: Christians distinguish between the economic Trinity (how God reveals himself in salvation history) and the immanent Trinity (how God is in himself). The economic Trinity refers to the different roles or missions of the three persons in relation to the world, while the immanent Trinity refers to the eternal relationships within the Godhead. The revelation of God in the economic Trinity reflects the eternal reality of the immanent Trinity, though our understanding of the immanent Trinity is limited by our finite and fallen human nature.
    
    The Use of Analogies: While analogies like the sun and its light or heat are not perfect representations of the Trinity, they serve as pedagogical tools to help finite minds grasp something of the mystery of the Trinity. The limitations of these analogies are acknowledged, and they are not meant to fully explain or contain the divine reality. Instead, they point to the possibility of a unity that is not uniformity and a diversity that is not division.
    
    </P>
 <P>Believing in the Biblical doctrine of the Trinity is a matter of no smallimportance. To worship a false god is idolatry (Exodus 20:1-3), and all “idolaters . . .shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone” (Revelation 21:8).God must be worshipped in truth (John 4:24), but this is impossible if we have a falseview of His nature. Holding improper ideas of God is in itself a great sin, and a cause offurther evils (Exodus 20:4-6; Romans 1:18-25). One who believes in a false god or godscontinually breaks the greatest of all commandments (Mark 12:29). Those who deny theDeity of the Father (John 17:3), of the Son (John 8:24), or of the Spirit (Acts 19:2) arelost. Scripture states that those with an improper view of the Person and saving work ofthe Son as God and man are unsaved (2 John 9) antichrists (1 John 2:22-23). Believing inthe Trinity, then, is essential to salvation. Furthermore, Scripture commands, “love theLord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind” (Matthew22:37). Love with the heart and the soul will lead the people of God to a longing to knowtheir Lord ever the better, and love for Him with the mind will lead them to wish tounderstand all they can about Him. Those who have been brought into fellowship withJehovah already “know the Lord” (Hebrews 8:11), and having once tasted that the Lord isgracious, they wish for ever-greater depths of intellectual and relational knowledge ofHim. Furthermore, recognizing that their heavenly Father is seeking for worshippers(John 4:23), God’s own recognize the value of deep knowledge of Trinitiarian teachingfor the purpose of communicating the knowledge of God to the lost world (Mark 16:15;Psalm 67). Thus, the study of the doctrine of the Trinity is of immense value both forthose who deny the doctrine, and are thus in need of faith in that one God who alone candeliver them from sin and eternal death, and for all those who have already beenredeemed by Him.</P>
 <P>This study presupposes the Biblical truths that every word of Scripture wasinfallibly given by inspiration (2 Timothy 3:16) and perfectly preserved in the traditionaloriginal language texts (Psalm 12:6-7). This Bible, examined according to literal,  
    grammatical-historical interpretation, is its sole authority (2 Timothy 3:17). Additionalalleged revelation, common in many anti-Trinitarian religious systems, whether in theform of extra holy books, supposedly infallible or uniquely authoritative people ororganizations, or biased translations of Scripture,
    1
     are rejected (Revelation 22:18-19;</P>
 <P>The
    New World Translation
    (NWT) of the anti-Trinitarian Watchtower Society (WTS, “Jehovah’sWitnesses”) is a classic example. Rejecting the original language
   Textus Receptus
    of the standard EnglishBible for the last 400 years, the King James Version (KJV), which is based on the New Testament Greektext representative of the overwhelming majority of manuscripts, the NWT opted to follow a tiny minorityof corrupt manuscripts (a practice which is oddly followed by many other modern versions). The KingJames Bible was translated by some fifty incredibly scholarly men, such as Lancelot Andrews, who hadmastered fifteen languages, and John Bois, who had read the entire Old Testament in Hebrew when he wasfive years old. Every portion of the translation was scrutinized at least sixteen times during the translation process, even apart from the consideration that the KJV was the culmination of a century-long refining process beginning with the Tyndale Bible and subsequent English versions. Information about the KJVtranslators is available to the public and published in many books (i. e.,
   The Translators Revived,
    Alexander McClure. Port Huron, MI: Way of Life Literature, 2001; electronic ed., orig. pub. 1855.) Incontrast, the NWT was made by an anonymous “New World Bible Translation Committee.” TheWatchtower Society seeks to hide the identity of these men, but sources such as the former WatchtowerGoverning Body member Raymond Franz identify the constituents of the committee as seven men: FredFranz, Nathan Knorr, Milton Henschel, Albert Schroeder, Karl Klein, and George Gangas. The majority ofthese “translators” were high school drop-outs. None had ever graduated from college. Only one of themhad any training whatever in the Biblical languages—Fred Franz had taken one 2 credit hour course in NewTestament Greek and a number of courses in non-Biblical, classical Greek. None of the “translators” hadever taken any courses in Hebrew (or Aramaic) in their lives; they had no knowledge of the language ofthe Old Testament and simply were totally unable to translate it (see pg. 50,
   Crisis of Conscience,
   Raymond Franz, Atlanta, GA: Commentary Press, 1985; pg. 64,
    Kingdom of the Cults,
   Walter Martin(rev. ed), Minneapolis, MN: Bethany Fellowship, 1977; pgs. 105-106, 207,
    A Guide to Cults and New Religions,
    Ronald Enroth, Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1983.). They knew just about as muchHebrew as a Hebrew national hot dog. These facts make it clear why the Watchtower tries to hide theidentity of the WTS “translators.” No religious group in the world uses the NWT besides the Watchtowersociety because it is not a translation at all—the “translation” committee did not know the Biblicallanguages. It is a corruption that mutilates God’s Word when it contradicts Watchtower doctrine.</P>
 <P>A few examples of the many corruptions in the NWT include:1.) In Zechariah 12:10, Jehovah is speaking, and He says,
    “they [the Jews] shall look upon me [Heb. ‘elay]whom they have pierced.”
     Since this verse teaches that Jehovah was pierced by the Jews, and John 19:37shows that this verse refers to the death of Christ, proving that Jesus is Jehovah, the NWT changesZechariah 12:10 to
    “the One whom they pierced,”
     although this is impossible in Hebrew.2.)
     
    The NWT adds the words “other” or “others” to Acts 10:36, Phil 2:9; Col 1:16, 17, 20, despite the factthat the word is not in any Greek MSS in the entire world, because without the addition Jesus Christ is“Lord of all,” has a Name “above every name,” and He created “all things” and is “before all things,” andso is Jehovah the Creator. God’s Word contradicts their doctrine, so they change His Word, instead ofrepenting of their doctrine.3.) 1 Tim 4:1 reads,
    “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly,”
     but the WTS does not believe that the Spirit is a personal Being who can speak, so it replaces “Spirit” with “inspired utterance.” Similarly, in Genesis 1:2,God’s Word reads “the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters,” showing that the Spirit wasinvolved in creation, but the Watchtower denies that the Holy Spirit is the Creator, so it changes “Spirit” to“active force.”The Watchtower Society claims that the NWT is the true Bible because it has the name
     Jehovah
     init more times than the KJV. The KJV does use the name
     Jehovah
     in various verses (Ex 6:3; Is 12:2, etc.), but usually it renders the Hebrew
    hOÎwh
    ◊
    y
     as
     LORD
    instead in the Old Testament (OT). Rather than beingmotivated by any sinister plot to malign Jehovah’s name, the KJV translators were simply following the

    II. The Definition of the Doctrine of the Trinity
    It is very valuable in any sort of debate or discussion for all parties involved toknow exactly what it is they are talking about. This is all the more necessary in adiscussion of the doctrine of the Trinity, as its opponents have, with great frequency,evidenced either ignorance of the doctrine they are opposing or intentionalmisrepresentation of the Trinitarian position, and, in these days of apostasy and spiritiualweakness in Christiandom, many even of the people of God are less able to give theaccurate, orthodox doctrine as confessed for nearly two thousand years. A short    
    definition of the triune nature of the Godhead
    3
     would be, “One God in essence whoeternally exists in three distinct Persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.”

     Asomewhat larger definition from a standard confession of faith of Christian churchesdeclares that “The Lord our God is but one only living and true God . . . in this divine andinfinite Being there are three subsistences, the Father, the Word (or Son), and the HolySpirit, of one substance, power, and eternity, each having the whole divine essence, yetthe essence undivided: the Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding; the Son iseternally begotten of the Father; the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son;all infinite, without beginning, therefore but one God, who is not to be divided in natureand being, but distinguished by several peculiar relative properties and personal relations;which doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our communion with God, andcomfortable dependence on Him.”

    6
     which deals bothwith the nature of the relations of the three in the Triune God

     8
      the Father; by him all things weremade.For us men, and for our salvation, he came down from heaven, and wasincarnate by the Holy Ghost of the virgin Mary, and was made man.
     9
      He wascrucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried, and the thirdday he rose again, according to the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven, and isseated at the right hand of the Father; from thence he will come again with gloryto judge the living and the dead; His kingdom will have no end.And we believe in the Holy Spirit, who is Lord and God, the giver of life, both one in essence with and proceeding from the Father and the Son, who withthe Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified, who spoke through the prophets.

     Shedd states, “the following reasons for the incarnation of the second person, rather than of thefirst or third: . . . First, that by the incarnation the names of the divine persons should remain unchanged; sothat neither the Father nor the Holy Spirit should have to take the name of a Son. Secondly, it was fittingthat by the incarnation men should become God’s adopted sons, through him who is God’s natural Son.Thirdly, it was proper that man, who occupies a middle position between angels and beasts, in the scale ofcreatures, should be redeemed by the middle person in the trinity. Lastly, it was proper that the fallen natureof man which was created by the Word (John 1:3) should be restored by him. In addition to these reasons, itis evident that it is more fitting that a father should commis ion and send a son upon an errand of mercy,than that a son should commission and send a father” (William G.

     The
     hypostatic union
      refers to the extremely important fact of the union of the Divine and humannatures in Christ. Charles L. Feinberg (“The Hypostatic Union,”
      Bibliotheca Sacra,
      92:368 (Oct 1935), pgs. 412-426) explains that when “we have postulated the two natures in Christ, we are not by so muchattributing to Him a dual personality. We never read in the Word that one nature in Christ speaks to theother or is distinguished from it as a distinct hypostasis. Nowhere in the Scriptures does the Son of God address the Son of man or vice versa (cf. Rom 1:2–5; 9:5; 1 John 1:1–3; John 1:1–14). ‘The human and theDivine nature exist in the person of the Redeemer by no means only outwardly together, or parallel to eachother, but so intimately united that this personality is as little merely human as exclusively Divine, but isand remains to all eternity, Divine-human.’ So real is this union that in Scripture human attributes areascribed to Him when He is designated by a divine title, and divine attributes when addressed by a humantitle (cf. Acts 20:28; 1 Cor 2:8; Col 1:13, 14; John 3:13; Rom 9:5; Rev 5:12).Another feature to be kept in mind with regard to the hypostatic union is the fact that the divinenature was always hypostasized. The preincarnate Logos ever existed as a personality, the Second Personof the Trinity. The Logos was never enhypostatic [that is, without personality]. . . .When the two natures united in Christ and the human nature received its personality from that ofthe Logos, this does not imply that the natures became somehow confused or commingled. Indeed, thenatures maintain and retain their distinctness throughout together with their properties. . . . The two naturesdo not unite to form a theanthropic nature, but a theanthropic Person . . . what the Scriptures seek toconvey is that the properties of both the human nature and divine nature are communicated to thetheanthropic Person constituted of them.Just a word need be said now concerning the consciousness of Christ. Some say He had a humanconsciousness; some hold a divine consciousness; others a divine-human consciousness. Christ had twoforms of consciousness and experience: one in the realm of the human and one in the realm of the divine.But He had only one self-consciousness. He spoke of Himself with the first personal pronoun, was spokento with the second personal pronoun, and spoken about with the third personal pronoun.An error to be guarded against in considering this subject is that which would say the divine natureunited with a human person. Because the human nature united with a divine Person when it united with adivine nature, does not warrant us in drawing a parallel for the human nature. . . . [T]he human nature before the union was enhypostatic, and have also called attention in our introduction to the distinction between nature and person. The Logos did not take up into His consciousness the ‘whole human nature both distributed and undistributed, individualized, and undividualized, but only a transmitted fractional partof the undistributed remainder of it, as this existed in the Virgin Mary.’ If the preincarnate Logos hadunited with a human person, there would have been another person added to the trinity which would havesensibly altered its constituency. . . .[T]he hypostatic union is eternal. Scripture reveals nowhere that this union may sometime bedissolved. On the contrary, we read: “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever.” He is“over all, God blessed for ever.” This union did not cease for a moment while He was on earth. Now inheaven the glorified God-man continues unchangeably. Throughout all eternity it shall be the Man ChristJesus.”Feinberg also clarifies that the “union known as the hypostatic union is not analogous to anywithin the realm of human experience. Many attempts have been made, with recognition of theirinsufficiency and inadequacy to be sure, to liken it to the union in man of soul and body, or the union ofiron and heat to get molten ore. When we speak of the hypostatic union, it is not meant to convey the ideaof an indwelling of deity comparable to the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of believers. Nor arethe two natures bound together by the moral tie of friendship or sympathy. The manner of the union isconfessedly inscrutable.But there are clear features of this truth yet to be dealt with. The question arises early in one’sthinking on the subject as to which nature forms the basis of the divine-human personality. Did thehumanity of Christ take on or assume deity or was the reverse condition true? . . . We believe the truth ofthe matter to be that the divine nature in Christ formed the basis of His personality. The human nature inChrist could not have been the foundation of His personality, because before the union with the divinenature it was enhypostatic, without individuation. The human nature in Christ was never personalized untilthe miraculous conception when it was joined to the divine nature, the Logos. If the human nature had beenthe base of His Person He would be a man-God, not God-man, anthropotheistic, not theanthropic. Sheddnotes several other reasons in favor of this position. First, the divine nature must have been the primaryone, because the theanthropic personality was not destroyed when Christ died. Second, Christ’s acts of power, as well as His knowledge, were regulated by the divine nature. If the Logos determined Christ was powerful and could not be apprehended; if the Logos chose Christ could be arrested, scourged, andcrucified. If the Logos elected that Christ knew certain matters, He knew them, otherwise the reverse wastrue. The Logos always knew the hour of the Second Advent, but He did not care to vouchsafe this knowledge to the human consciousness of Jesus Christ. Third, Christ’s immutability is another proof of thiscontention. The Word states that “Jesus Christ [is] the same yesterday, and today, and for ever” (Heb 13:8).Although the divine nature formed the starting point of the personality of Christ, this does notmean that His human nature was any the less real or complete. In Jesus Christ true deity and true humanitywere consciously and actually present in the fullest sense of the word. All that could be predicated of Godthe Father and God the Holy Spirit as to deity could with equal justification be said of Christ. Thoughhumbled, He was ever and always God. In fact, He could not have humbled Himself in the manner that Hedid, had He not been truly God. But at the same time Christ was every whit a man. All that can beattributed to unfallen humanity was true of Christ. He was without sin, but sin is not an essential feature oftrue humanity, for Adam was without sin in his innocent state. . . .What are the benefits of this union? First of all, the hypostatic union gave the world an impeccablePerson. This predicates of Christ, mark you, not only anamartesia, but impeccability. It is not just a matterof
 posse non peccare
, but of
non posse peccare
. It is not enough to say Christ did not sin; it must bedeclared unequivocably that He could not sin. . . .A second consequence of the hypostatic union was that the God-man revealed the Father. Whenmen wanted to see God, Christ so manifested Him that He could say: “he that hath seen me hath seen theFather” (John 14:9). Never before nor since has God been so clearly revealed to men. But if Christ was therevealer of deity as God-man, He was likewise the revealer of true humanity. He alone of all men that everwalked the earth was utterly dependent upon God. God was in all His thoughts. In all things He pleased notHimself but the Father. He solely kept the whole law. He displayed to men what true humanity is. . . .Yet another benefit of the union is that Christ can be a sacrifice for sin. This is well typified by theKinsman-Redeemer who must meet certain qualifications. He must be a near kinsman; he must be able toredeem; he must be willing to redeem; he must be free from the difficulty himself. Christ answered to thisdescription by becoming man, thus identifying Himself with the human race. The ultimate sacrifice for sinhad to be a man, not bulls and goats, because man had sinned in the body here on earth and deserved deathas the legitimate wages of sin. Therefore, Christ was a man. But to give this sacrifice its ineffably infinitevalue, in order to suffice as a propitiation for the sins of the whole world, He had to be God. The truesacrifice for sin had to be a God-man; this is provided for by the hypostatic union.A further consequence of the union was that it furnished for redeemed humanity a faithful High-Priest. As a prophet speaks for God to men, so a priest speaks for men to God. In dying for sinful manChrist fulfilled only part of His high-priestly office. It involves, furthermore, intercession and advocacy.These phases of ministry are in behalf of believers only. The Lord Jesus as God-man intercedes for Hisown that they may be kept from the evil one while they are in the world, though not of it. He advocates forHis own after they have sinned. In order to intercede or advocate He must be God to know fully God’srequirements of man and how to meet them, and He must be fully man to understand man’s need and betouched by the feeling of man’s infirmities. For this the hypostatic union was indispensable. “For there isone God, and one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Tim. 2:5). Job’s plaintive cryfor a Daysman who can lay hold of both God for man and man for God has been answered and gloriouslyso.Finally, by the hypostatic union the Logos became the head of a new race, the new creation.Romans 5:12–21 shows clearly that as death, condemnation, and judgment came from the first Adam to thefallen race, so from the Last Adam accrue to believers the new creation in Christ Jesus (Eph 2:10), life,righteousness, and justification. The Logos had to become man to undo (and “much more”) what the firstman had wrought. He had to be God to grant and make possible such heavenly birth, privileges, and blessings (Eph 1:3) to those who willingly follow Him by faith (cf. 1 Cor 15:45; Eph 1:22; John 15:5; 2 Cor5:17).</p>
 <p>It should be mentioned that the fact that Christ has a complete Divine nature and a completehuman nature involves the truth that He has two wills, a Divine will (Luke 13:24; John 5:21) and a humanwill (Luke 22:42; John 6:38). An ancient Biblical declaration on this issue (here somewhat edited andcondensed) stated that “we likewise preach two natural wills in Jesus Christ, and two natural operationsundivided, inconvertible, inseparable, and unmixed; and the two natural wills are not contrary, but hishuman will follows the divine will, and is not resisting or reluctant, but rather subject to his divine andomnipotent will. Therefore we confess two natural wills and operations, harmoniously united for thesalvation of the human race.” This truth of two wills is known as
    dyothelitism,
     as opposed to the heretical position of only one will,
    monothelitism.

    Since the Lord Jesus is one Person with two complete natures, a fully human nature and a fullyDivine nature, what is true of either nature can be predicated of His Person. This doctrine, known as the
    communicatio idiomatum
     (in English, “The Communication of Properties,” in Greek, the
    aÓnti¿dosiß
     or
    aÓntimeta¿stasiß
    ) explains that “by reason of the Unity of [Christ’s] Person, that which is proper to onenature, is sometimes in Scripture attributed to the Person denominated by the other nature” (
    The London Baptist Confession of Faith of 1689,
     8:7). For example, John 3:13 speaks of the “the Son of man which isin heaven.” The human nature of Christ was not in heaven at that time, but on the earth in the land ofIsrael, where the Lord was speaking to a man named Nicodemus (John 3:1-2). Nevertheless, because thePerson who is the fully human “Son of man” is also fully God, and thus omnipresent (Jeremiah 23:24;Matthew 18:20), and “in heaven,” on earth, and everywhere else in the universe at the same time, Scripturecan connect the humanity of the Savior with omnipresence. Acts 20:28 states that “God . . . hath purchased[the church] with his own blood,” although blood pertains to the human nature of Christ, not to Hisimmaterial, incorporeal, spiritual Divine nature (John 4:24; Luke 24:39), for only one Person possesses both those two natures. Compare 1 Corinthians 2:8, where men “crucified [human nature] the Lord ofglory [Divine nature].” In this manner of Scriptural speech, the properties of one nature are not applied tothe other nature as such, but to the Subject, the Son of God, who possesses both natures. Christ’s divinenature does not possess the properties of humanity (such as being created or localized in space), nor doesHis human nature possess the properties of Divinity (such as being uncreated or omnipresent), but since theLord is one Person, whether He is named by reason of both natures together, or only of one of them, He is properly assigned the properties of either nature. It should also be noted that in a manner similar to thecoinherence of the three Persons of the Trinity (see footnote #13), the two natures of Christ, while eternallyand unchangeably distinct, share one common life and interpenetrate each other.
    15
     
    In other words, the
    hupostasis
     of the Father, the
    hupostasis
     of the Son, and the
    hupostasis
     of theSpirit are distinct, and must not be confused the one with the other; while the three share only one essenceor
    ousia.
     (Since this creed was originally composed in Latin, it employs the equivalents in that language(

    ) to the Greek
    ousia
     and
    hupostasis
    .</p>
 <p>Son: another of the Holy Ghost.
    16
     But the Godhead of the Father, and of the Son,and of the Holy Ghost is all one: the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal. Such asthe Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost. The Father is uncreated:the Son is uncreated: the Holy Ghost is uncreated. The Father is immeasurable:the Son is immeasurable: the Holy Ghost is immeasurable. The Father is eternal:the Son eternal: the Holy Ghost eternal. And yet there are not three eternals; butone eternal. As also there are not three uncreated: nor three immeasurable: but oneuncreated, and one immeasurable. So likewise the Father is Almighty: the SonAlmighty: and the Holy Ghost Almighty, and yet there are not three Almighties: but one Almighty. So the Father is God: the Son is God: and the Holy Ghost isGod. And yet there are not three Gods; but one God. So the Father is Lord: theSon Lord: and the Holy Ghost Lord. And yet not three Lords; but one Lord. Forlike as we are compelled by Christian truth to acknowledge every Person byhimself to be God and Lord, So are we forbidden by the Christian religion to say,there are three Gods, or three Lords. The Father is made of none; neither created;nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone: not made; nor created; but begotten.The Holy Ghost is of the Father and the Son: not made; neither created; nor begotten; but proceeding. Thus there is one Father, not three Fathers: one Son, notthree Sons: one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts. And in this Trinity none is before or after another: none is greater or less than another. But the whole threePersons are co-eternal together, and co-equal. So that in all things, as aforesaid,the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped. He thereforethat will be saved, must thus think of the Trinity.

   William G. T. Shedd writes, concerning the Divine consiousousness, “the Scriptures teach that theFather, Son, and Holy Spirit are three persons independently and irrespective of creation, redemption, andsanctification. If God had never created the universe, but had existed alone from all eternity, he would betriune. And the three persons are so real and distinct from each other, that each possesses a hypostatical ortrinitarian consciousness different from that of the others. The second person is conscious that he is theSon, and not the Father, when he says, “O Father, glorify thou me,” John 17:5. The first person is consciousthat he is the Father and not the Son, when he says, “Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee,”Hebrews 1:5. The third person is conscious that he is the Spirit, and neither the Father nor the Son, when hesays, “Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them,” Acts 13:2. These threehypostatical consciousnesses constitute the one self-consciousness of the Divine essence. By reason of, andas the result of these three forms of consciousness, the Divine essence is self-contemplative, self-cognitive,and self-communing. Though there are three forms of consciousness, there are not three essences, or threeunderstandings, or three wills, in the Godhead; because, a consciousness is not an essence, or anunderstanding or a will. There is only one essence, having one understanding, and one will. But this unityof essence, understanding, and will, has three different forms of consciousness: namely, the Paternal, theFilial, and the Spiritual; because it has three different forms of subsistence: namely, the Father, the Son, andthe Spirit. If it had only one form of subsistence, as in the Sabellian scheme, it would have only one form ofconsciousness. It would exist only as a single subject, and would have only a corresponding consciousness.But this would not be a full and true self-consciousness, because this requires the three distinctions ofsubject, object, and percipient-subject, which are not given in the Sabellian triad.It must be noticed that the Divine self-consciousness is not a fourth consciousness additional to thethree hypostatical consciousnesses, but is the resultant of these three. The three hypostaticalconsciousnesses are the one Divine self-consciousness, and the one Divine self-consciousness is the threehypostatical consciousnesses. The three hypostatical consciousnesses in their, combination and unityconstitute the one self-consciousness. The essence in being trinally conscious as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is self-conscious. As the one Divine essence is the same thing with the three persons, and not afourth different thing by itself, so the one Divine self-consciousness is the same thing with the threehypostatical consciousnesses, and not a fourth different thing by itself. In this way, it is evident that thethree hypostatical consciousnesses are consistent with a single selfconsciousness, as the three hypostasesthemselves are consistent with a single essence. There are three persons, but only one essence; and threehypostatical consciousnesses, but only one self-consciousness” (

“Incarnation must be distinguished from transmutation, or transubstantiation. The phrase ‘becameman’ does not mean that the second person in the trinity ceased to be God. This would betransubstantiation. One substance, the divine, would be changed or converted into another substance, thehuman. . . . In saying that “the Word was made flesh” (John 1:14), it is meant that the Word came to possess human characteristics in addition to his divine, which still remained as before. The properties of thedivine nature cannot be either destroyed or altered. A human nature was united with the divine, in orderthat the resulting person might have a human form of consciousness as well as a divine. Previous to theassumption of a human nature, the Logos could not experience a human feeling because he had no humanheart, but after this assumption he could; previous to the incarnation, he could not have a finite perception because he had no finite intellect, but after this event he could; previous to the incarnation, the self-consciousness of the Logos was eternal only, that is, without succession, but subsequent to theincarnation it was both eternal and temporal, with and without succession. This twofold consciousness may be illustrated by the union between the human soul and body. Prior to, or apart from its union with amaterial body, a man’s immaterial soul cannot feel a physical sensation or a sensuous appetite; but whenunited with it in a personal union, it can so feel. In like manner, prior to the incarnation, the second personof the Trinity could not have human sensations and experiences; but after it he could. The unincarnateLogos could think and feel only like God; he hadonly one form of consciousness. The incarnate Logos can think and feel either like God, or like man; he hastwo modes or forms of consciousness.When, therefore, it is said that “God became man,” the meaning is that God united himself withman, not that God changed himself into man. Unification of two natures, not transmutation of one natureinto another is meant. We might say of the union of soul and body, in the instance of a human person, that“spirit becomesmatter;” that is, is materialized or embodied. We would not mean by this phrase, that spirit is actuallychanged into matter, but that it is united with matter in that intimate manner which is denominated personalunion. In the incarnation, God is humanized, as in ordinary human generation, spirit is materialized orembodied. Each substance, however, still retains its own properties. In an ordinary man, spirit remainsimmaterial, and body remains material; and in the God-man, the divine nature remains divine in its properties, and the human remains human. . . .The distinctive characteristic of the incarnation is the union of two diverse natures, a divine and ahuman, so as to constitute one single person. A single person may consist of one nature, or of two natures,or of three. A trinitarian person has only one nature: namely, the divine essence. A human person has twonatures: namely, a material body, and an immaterial soul. A theanthropic person has three natures: namely,the divine essence, a human soul, and a human body. By the incarnation, not a God, not a man, but a God-man is constituted. A theanthropic person is a trinitarian person modified by union with a human nature similarly as a trinitarian person is the Divine essence modified by generation, or spiration. A theanthropic person is constituted, consequently, in the same generalmanner in which an ordinary human person is: namely, by the union of diverse natures. In the case of ahuman individual, it is the combination of one material nature and one immaterial that makes him a person.. . . Says Hooker (V. liv.), ‘the incarnation of the Son of God consisteth merely in the union of natures,which union doth add perfection to the weaker, to the nobler no alteration at all.’The divine-human person, Jesus Christ, was produced by the union of the divine nature of theLogos with a human nature derived from a human mother. Before this union was accomplished, there wasno theanthropic person. There was the divine person of the Logos existing in the Trinity before this union,and there was the unindividualized substance of Christ’s human nature existing in the virgin Mary beforethis union; but until the two were united at the instant of the miraculous conception, there was no God-man.The trinitarian personality of the Son of God did not begin at the incarnation, but the theanthropic personality of Jesus Christ did. . . .It is the divine nature, and not the human, which is the base of Christ’s person. The secondtrinitarian person is the root and stock into which the human nature is grafted. The wild olive is grafted intothe good olive, and partakes of its root and fatness” (William G. T. Shedd,
 Dogmatic Theology

While analogies for the Trinity from human experience, such as comparing the unity of the threePersons to the three states of water as gas, liquid, and solid, or to the human intellect, memory, and will, orto one who loves, the one loved, and the love itself, or to a father, mother, and son, etc. can have a certainvalue, since nothing in the earthly experience of mankind is exactly comparable to the tri-unity of God,they all of necessity fall short of an entirely accurate representation of the Biblical teaching and run the riskof misrepresenting the Trinitarian faith. This limitation must always be in mind when utilizing suchillustrations.

Schaff provides further helpful thoughts on the classical doctrine of the Trinity:“There is only
one
 divine
essence
 or
 substance
 (
ousia, substantia, essentia, phusis, natura
).Father, Son, and Spirit are one in essence, or consubstantial
(homoousioi).
 They are in one another,inseparable, and cannot be conceived without each other. In this point the [classic] doctrine is thoroughlymonotheistic . . . in distinction from tritheism, which is but a new form of the polytheism of the pagans.The terms
essence
 (
ousia
) and
nature
 (
 phusis
) . . . denote . . . against Arianism the strict divinityand essential equality of the Son and Holy Ghost with the Father. . . . [I]n the divine Trinityconsubstantiality denotes not only sameness of kind, but at the same time
numerical 
 unity; not merely the
unum in specie
, but also the
unum in numero
. The, three persons are related to the divine substance not asthree individuals to their species, as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, or Peter, John, and Paul, to human nature;they are only one God. The divine substance is absolutely indivisible by reason of its simplicity, andabsolutely inextensible and untransferable by reason of its infinity; whereas a corporeal substance can bedivided, and the human nature can be multiplied by generation. Three divine substances would limit andexclude each other, and therefore could not be infinite or absolute. The whole fulness of the one undividedessence of God, with all its attributes, is in all the persons of the Trinity, though in each in his own way: inthe Father as original principle, in the Son by eternal generation, in the Spirit by, eternal procession. Thechurch teaches not
one
 divine essence
and 
 three persons, but
one
 essence
in
 three persons. Father, Son, and Spirit cannot be conceived as three separate individuals, but are in one another, and form a solidaric unity. .. . In this one divine essence there are three persons or, to use a better term, hypostases, that is, threedifferent modes of subsistence of the one same undivided and indivisible whole, which in the Scriptures arecalled the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. These distinctions are not merely different attributes, powers, or activities of the Godhead, still less merely subjective aspects under which it presents itself to thehuman mind; but each person expresses the whole fulness of the divine being with all its attributes, and thethree persons stand in a relation of mutual knowledge and love. . . . Here the orthodox doctrine forsookSabellianism or modalism, which, it is true, made Father, Son, and Spirit strictly coordinate, but only asdifferent denominations and forms of manifestation of the one God.But, on the other hand, as we have already intimated, the term
 person
 must not be taken here in thesense current among men, as if the three persons were three different individuals, or three self-consciousand separately acting beings. The trinitarian idea of personality lies midway between that of a mere form ofmanifestation, or a personation, which would lead to Sabellianism, and the idea of an independent, limitedhuman personality, which would result in tritheism. In other words, it avoids the
monoousian
 or[modalistic] trinity of a threefold conception and aspect of one and the same being, and the
triousian
 ortritheistic trinity of three distinct and separate beings. In each person there is the same inseparable divinesubstance, united with the individual property and relation which distinguishes that person from the others.The word person is in reality only a make-shift, in the absence of a more adequate term. Our idea of God ismore true and deep than our terminology, and the essence and character of God far transcends our highestideas. . . .Each divine person has his
 property
, as it were a characteristic individuality, expressed by theGreek word
idiotes
, and the Latin
 proprietas
. This is not to be confounded with attribute; for the divineattributes, eternity, omnipresence, omnipotence, wisdom, holiness, love, etc., are inherent in the divine
essence
, and are the common possession of all the divine hypostases. The
idiotes
, on the contrary, is a peculiarity of the
hypostasis
, and therefore cannot be communicated or transferred from one to another.To the first person fatherhood, or the being unbegotten
(agennesia, paternitas)
, is ascribed as his property; to the second, sonship, or the being begotten
(gennesia, genesis, generatio filiatio)
, to the HolyGhost, procession
(ekporeusis, procesio;
 also
ekpempsis, missio)
. In other words: The Father is unbegotten, but begetting; the Son is uncreated, but begotten; the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father . . . and . . . alsofrom the Son. But these distinctions relate, as we have said, only to the hypostases, and have no force withrespect to the divine essence which is the same in all, and neither begets nor is begotten, nor proceeds, noris sent.The divine persons are in one another, mutually interpenetrate, and form a perpetual
intercommunication
 and
motion
 within the divine essence; as the Lord says: “I am in the Father, and theFather in me;” and “the Father . . . dwelleth in me” [John 14:10-11; cf. John 10:38. Note in John 14:10 thatthe correct text is
oJ de« path\r oJ e˙n e˙moi« me÷nwn, aujto\ß poiei
      √
 ta» e¶rga
. The
oJ e˙n e˙moi« me÷nwn
 emphasizes the ontic character of the coinherence. 99.5% of MSS contain this
oJ;
 three do not. To rejectthousands of MSS and claim only three have the right text is insane.]. This perfect indwelling and vitalcommunion was afterwards designated (by John of Damascus and the scholastics) by such terms as
enuparxis, perichoresis, inexistentia, immanentia, inhabitatio, circulatio, permeatio, intercommunio,circumincessio
,
 
[and in English is commonly referred to as the doctrine of
coinherence
]
.
 The [classical] doctrine . . . contains, in substance, a distinction between two trinities: animmanent [or ontological] trinity of constitution
(ad intra, tropos uparxeos)
, which existed from eternity,and an economic trinity of manifestation
(ad extra, tropos apokalupseos)
 . . . for the generation of the Sonand the procession of the Spirit are, according to the doctrine, an eternal process. The . . . [immanent]trinity of revelation [is seen] in the threefold progressive work of the creation, the redemption, and the preservation of the world, [and points] back thence to a trinity of being; for God has revealed himself as heis, and there can be no contradiction between his nature and his works. The eternal pre-existence of the Sonand the Spirit is the background of the historical revelation by which they work our salvation.” (
 History ofthe Christian Church,
 Philip Schaff, vol. 3, 9:130).The Trinitiarian doctrine of coinherence is “not merely a linking or intercommunication of thedistinctive properties of the three divine Presons but a complete mutual indwelling in which each Person,while remaining what he is by himself as Father, Son, or Holy Spirit, is wholly in the others as the othersare wholly in him” (Torrance,
The Trinitarian Faith,
 pg 305). Coinherence describes “the intimate mutualunion of the persons . . . so as to designate thus that union by which the divine persons embrace each other and permeate (if it is right to say so) each other. So that although always remaining distinct, yet they arenever separated from each other, but always coexist; wherever one is, there the other also really is”(

   This distinction in terminology, such that
   Unitarianism
    signifies Arianism or subordinationism
    ,
    while
   modalism
    refers to Sabellianism or Patripassianism, will be maintained for the course of thisdiscussion. One could argue that modalism is itself a form of Unitarianism, since it affirms, as doesArianism, a single person in the Divine essence. However, these two heresies arrive at this conclusionthrough very different means. Sabellianism maintains the unitary person of its Godhead is Father, Son, andSpirit, while Arianism maintains that the Father is the only One who is properly God. As defined in thiswork, Unitarianism denies the identity of the true God with the Son and the Spirit because it recognizesthem as distinct from the Father, while modalism affirms the identity of Son and Spirit with the true God because it views the terms as synonyms of “Father.”

       The Three-Personed God,
        William J. Hill (Washington, D. C.: CatholicUniversity of America Press, 1982). One noteworthy thing that can be gleaned from the mounds of nonsense in such a study is the fact that orthodox, classical Trinitarianism is under severe attack within both Catholicism and mainline Protestantism. The assumption that Bible-believing Baptist churches, thekind founded by the Lord Jesus Christ in the first century and perpetuated from that time to the present byHis Almighty power (Matthew 16:18; 28:20; 1 Corinthians 11:26; Ephesians 3:21) are Trinitarian becauseof such apostate “Christian” religions is entirely erroneous—especially since genuine Trinitarianism isitself under both Catholic and Protestant assault.

        The language quoted comes from an appendix to the ancient Nicene creed, which is related to the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed cited earlier, and was written to oppose Arianism, an ancient form ofUnitarianism. The appendix correctly affirms that those who believe the views mentioned about the Son ofGod are
        anathema,
         that is, cursed by the Lord and condemned to hell (2 John 9; 1 Corinthians 16:22;Galatians 1:8-9). The modern Arians in the Watchtower society declare that “Jesus never claimed to beGod. Everything he said about himself indicates that he did not consider himself equal to God in any way”(

        25
         
        The Unitarian Arius, from whom the term
         Arianism
         is derived, at first affirmed the personality ofthe Spirit, while denying His Deity, but, as a recognition of the personality of the Spirit leads to aconsequent affirmation of His Deity, Arius’ followers, and modern Bible-affirming Unitarians, aregenerally united in their rejection of the Holy Spirit’s personality.
